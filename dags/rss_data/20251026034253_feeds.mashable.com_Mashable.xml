<h2>What is <em>Connections: Sports Edition</em>?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has launched in association with <em>The Athletic</em>, the New York Times property that provides the publication's sports coverage. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-october-17-2025" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer.</p><p>If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake &mdash; players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02INHDN4rzK3bnF9v6MRUEJ/hero-image.jpg" alt="A phone with the Pips logo."><p>Happy Friday and welcome to your guide to Pips, the latest game in the <a href="https://www.nytco.com/games/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">New York Times</a> catalogue.</p><p>Released in August 2025, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-mini-crossword-answers-hints-september-19-2025" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pips</a> puts a unique spin on dominoes, creating a fun single-player experience that could become your next daily gaming habit.</p><p>Currently, if you're stuck, the game only offers to reveal the entire puzzle, forcing you to move onto the next difficulty level and start over. However, we have you covered! Below are piecemeal answers that will serve as hints so that you can find your way through each difficulty level.</p><h2>How to play Pips</h2><p>If you've ever played dominoes, you'll have a passing familiarity for how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/pips" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pips</a> is played. As we've shared in our previous hints stories for Pips, the tiles, like dominoes, are placed vertically or horizontally and connect with each other. The main difference between a traditional game of dominoes and Pips is the color-coded conditions you have to address. The touching tiles don't necessarily have to match.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>The conditions you have to meet are specific to the color-coded spaces. For example, if it provides a single number, every side of a tile in that space must add up to the number provided. It is possible &ndash; and common &ndash; for only half a tile to be within a color-coded space.</p><p>Here are common examples you'll run into across the difficulty levels:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Number</strong>: All the pips in this space must add up to the number.</p></li><li><p><strong>Equal</strong>: Every domino half in this space must be the same number of pips.</p></li><li><p><strong>Not Equal</strong>: Every domino half in this space must have a completely different number of pips.</p></li><li><p><strong>Less than</strong>: Every domino half in this space must add up to less than the number.</p></li><li><p><strong>Greater than:</strong> Every domino half in this space must add up to more than the number.</p></li></ul><p>If an area does not have any color coding, it means there are no conditions on the portions of dominoes within those spaces.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By providing an opaque hint and not providing the word list, Strands creates a brain-teasing game that takes a little longer to play than its other games, like <a href="https://mashable.com/category/wordle" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/connections" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Connections</a>.</p><p>If you're feeling stuck or just don't have 10 or more minutes to figure out today's puzzle, we've got all the NYT Strands hints for today's puzzle you need to progress at your preferred pace.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

      <description><![CDATA[Decades of forum arguments ended this week when Microsoft announced a version of 'Halo' for PS5.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/027D8sDf6VW7J3x84yc2ZnF/hero-image.jpg" alt="Halo Campaign Evolved screenshot"><p>There were headlines about <a href="https://mashable.com/article/xbox-president-sarah-bond-confirms-next-gen-console" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the next Xbox console</a> this week, but the biggest news out of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/xbox" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Microsoft's gaming division</a> actually concerned a competitor's platform.</p><p>On Friday, Xbox and current series developer Halo Studios announced <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em>. As its name suggests, this is a full-scale remake of the original <em>Halo</em> single-player campaign, built in Unreal Engine 5. It features all of the original levels, plus some new gameplay features on top of the rebuilt visuals. It's set for release sometime in 2026, and in a shocking development for anyone who used internet forums 20 years ago, it's coming to PlayStation 5 as well as Xbox and PC.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div class="youtube-video-container" id="video-container-01K8F63H04744QDTHF2W2JN5MN"></div>
</div>


<p>As you can see in a lengthy gameplay demo video set in perhaps the game's most famous level, The Silent Cartographer, Halo Studios has done some work on this game beyond just making it look more like a modern title. Features from later&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>&nbsp;games, like sprinting and the ability to aim down sights with every weapon, have made their way into this game. There will also be some weapons that weren't present in the first <em>Halo</em>, such as the Battle Rifle and Energy Sword, available for use in this game. Halo Studios is also promising three new prequel levels, but did not show them off or specify what they would be about.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>This is interesting on a number of levels. First and foremost, for those of us who are old enough to remember the console wars of yesteryear, seeing <em>Halo</em> on a PlayStation console is roughly akin to when they opened a McDonald's in the Soviet Union. It's an anticlimactic conclusion to a decades-long ideological struggle, one that you could see coming from a mile away if you'd been paying attention for the past few years. Microsoft has been slowly building up to this by releasing first-party titles like <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> and <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> on PS5 in recent months. <em>Halo</em> coming to PS5 in some form was inevitable.</p><p>It's also not without some controversy. Some longtime <em>Halo</em> fans online are not happy about the visual style on display here, while others have questioned the need to add new vehicles, weapons, and movement abilities to a game that arguably doesn't need them. One of the game's original level designers even weighed in on X to mildly criticize elements of the remake.</p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>That sort of thing is to be expected when remaking a bona fide classic like <em>Halo</em>, but at least on my social feeds, the reaction was harsher than usual. We'll see how it works out when <em>Campaign Evolved</em> launches sometime next year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04whclZTgrSWw0Zj6E0XLeQ/hero-image.jpg" alt="A phone with the Pips logo."><p>Happy Friday and welcome to your guide to Pips, the latest game in the <a href="https://www.nytco.com/games/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">New York Times</a> catalogue.</p><p>Released in August 2025, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-mini-crossword-answers-hints-september-19-2025" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pips</a> puts a unique spin on dominoes, creating a fun single-player experience that could become your next daily gaming habit.</p><p>Currently, if you're stuck, the game only offers to reveal the entire puzzle, forcing you to move onto the next difficulty level and start over. However, we have you covered! Below are piecemeal answers that will serve as hints so that you can find your way through each difficulty level.</p><h2>How to play Pips</h2><p>If you've ever played dominoes, you'll have a passing familiarity for how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/pips" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pips</a> is played. As we've shared in our previous hints stories for Pips, the tiles, like dominoes, are placed vertically or horizontally and connect with each other. The main difference between a traditional game of dominoes and Pips is the color-coded conditions you have to address. The touching tiles don't necessarily have to match.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>The conditions you have to meet are specific to the color-coded spaces. For example, if it provides a single number, every side of a tile in that space must add up to the number provided. It is possible &ndash; and common &ndash; for only half a tile to be within a color-coded space.</p><p>Here are common examples you'll run into across the difficulty levels:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Number</strong>: All the pips in this space must add up to the number.</p></li><li><p><strong>Equal</strong>: Every domino half in this space must be the same number of pips.</p></li><li><p><strong>Not Equal</strong>: Every domino half in this space must have a completely different number of pips.</p></li><li><p><strong>Less than</strong>: Every domino half in this space must add up to less than the number.</p></li><li><p><strong>Greater than:</strong> Every domino half in this space must add up to more than the number.</p></li></ul><p>If an area does not have any color coding, it means there are no conditions on the portions of dominoes within those spaces.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04HI5CDA4M1GfEBHXsCZQ1h/hero-image.jpg" alt="the eight sleep pod bed system on a mattress in a bright and clean bedroom "><p>During the early hours of Tuesday, Oct. 21, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/aws-outage-update-amazon-what-happened-why" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AWS went down</a>. You'd think that would simply mean we couldn't shop on Amazon or Woot in the middle of the night, but this is highly incorrect, as we all now know. The AWS outage took down what felt like half of the internet. WhatsApp, Snapchat, Venmo, Slack, banks, airlines, shipping networks, and trading platforms like Robinhood all went offline on a global scale.</p><p>Some folks were impacted by the AWS outage to the point of losing sleep. Yes, the spendy <a href="https://mashable.com/review/eight-sleep-pod-3-mattress-cover" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Eight Sleep Pod</a> system operates via a WiFi connection only, and the brand uses Amazon's cloud network to make that happen. Once AWS crashed, the Eight Sleep Pods lost connection to the mothership.</p><p>I'm in the process of testing the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/eight-sleep-pod-5-announcement" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Eight Sleep Pod 5</a> for Mashable, the latest version of the Eight Sleep system. My full review isn't out yet, but I was certainly one of the sad people who slept poorly due to the outage. While the experience was much better than other nights I've had (like sleeping on an airport floor), it wasn't a great night, and getting my bed back online once AWS was back online took me hours.</p><h2>The Eight Sleep Pod's (former?) WiFi addiction</h2><p>The Eight Sleep Pod is a pricey smart bed with several components. First, there's the Eight Sleep Pod's cover, which slips over your mattress like a fitted sheet. This cover contains small water channels that connect to the Pod's Hub, or the brains of the bed. The Hub connects to the Eight Sleep Pod app, and from there, users can set temperature preferences, schedules, and a wake-up alarm.</p><p>Should users add the Eight Sleep Pod Blanket to the Cover, the Hub can also control it. The Blanket essentially works in the same way as the Cover. It's laced with small water channels that either cool or heat the sleeper to their preferred settings. The Eight Sleep Pod also uses AI with an automatic mode that makes small temperature adjustments throughout the night to optimize sleep.</p><p>People are paying big money to equip their mattress with the Eight Sleep Pod system. In a queen-size, the current model, the Eight Sleep Pod 5 with Hub and Cover, is selling for $3,348. Add the blanket to this setup, and you're at a total of $4,348. For those who want to further upgrade the sleep experience, Eight Sleep also sells an adjustable base with fancy features like a built-in speaker, the ability to set an alarm with vibration, and snoring mitigation. Add the base to the setup and it's a grand total of $6,398.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

    </div>
<p>Every element of the Eight Sleep Pod requires a WiFi connection to work, so when AWS crashed, so did the Sleep Pod. The temperature regulation stopped working, the base's elevation and vibration functions went offline, alarms went dead, and the app did not function except to give an error message after a few minutes.</p><h2>Some sleepers were stuck in a real pickle</h2><p>My bedroom is chilly by design. I love a cold room with a warm, cozy bed. I keep the Eight Sleep Pod's Cover and Blanket, keeping me toasty but not sweating. I woke up sometime around 1 a.m. PT on Oct. 21 to a cold bed. Since the water in the cover and blanket was no longer warming, and my bedroom was probably about 55 degrees Fahrenheit, my bed was cold to the touch. The water had more or less taken on the ambient temperature in my room. </p><p>I dove into the app to fix my chills, and while waiting for it to load (it was not loading), I noticed I was lying totally flat, not the standard sleep position with head and legs slightly elevated the base typically adjusts to at night.</p><p>It took me maybe an hour to figure out my bed was offline because of the AWS outage. I found out by reinstalling X on my phone and then locating the <a href="https://x.com/EightSleepApp" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">EightSleepApp</a> account, which had posted about the outage to its 38 followers. At the time, the outage information wasn't posted to the brand's main X account, <a href="https://x.com/eightsleep" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">EightSleepPod</a>.</p><p>I put on warmer pajamas and socks and added more blankets to my bed, and eventually, my body heat seemed to heat up the water chambers well enough that I could sleep again.</p><p>Other users were not so lucky and took to the internet to explain they were way too cold or sweating thanks to a hot bed. Others said their bases were stuck in an elevated position. Since the app wouldn't load, there was no way to make temperature or elevation adjustments. People also said they didn't wake up on time since the alarm function on the Eight Sleep Pod was also offline.</p><h2>Changes coming to the Eight Sleep Pod</h2><p>Eight Sleep has since acknowledged the bed's reliance on WiFi, and the AWS is not ideal. The brand's CEO, Matteo Franceschetti, announced&nbsp;<a href="https://zdcs.link/a5X6nO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Backup%20Mode&object_type=article&object_uuid=04HI5CDA4M1GfEBHXsCZQ1h&short_url=a5X6nO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Backup Mode</a>&nbsp;on Oct. 22 via his&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/m_franceschetti/status/1981127629031035325" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">X account</a>. This new function allows users to alter the Pod's temperature and elevation when either the WiFi is out or the cloud network is down. Features vary slightly depending on which outage users are battling with, but the main problem of having no control over the temperature could be solved with this upgrade. Eight Sleep says the rollout is "gradual," and doesn't mention when all users will be in line for this new Bluetooth support.</p><p>This upgrade is great news for Eight Sleep Pod users who were left concerned about the expensive Pod's functionality during future outages. This is especially relevant as we head into stormy winter weather, which could turn <a href="https://mashable.com/category/wifirouters" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">WiFi routers</a> off, unless you use a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-portable-power-stations" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">portable power station</a>. </p><p>When all is said and done, we all gained a bit more knowledge this week. We now know AWS is one powerful beast that can legitimately ruin your slumber.</p>]]></content:encoded>

They state that "not all books are discounted for the entire length of the event, and we have noted that for each book based on our most recent update from the author." You can find every available title by following the <a href="https://www.drtstuffyourkindle.com/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">link on the hub page</a> to a helpful document. In that document, the author, book title, genre, tropes, and social links are all listed out so you can find something that ticks all your boxes.</p><h2>Is Stuff Your Kindle Day the same as Amazon Kindle Unlimited?</h2><p>Everything you download on Stuff Your Kindle Day is yours to keep forever, and there's no limit on the number of books you can download.

And yet this movie is <em>frightening</em> in a way that&rsquo;s really hard to pin down&hellip;how did <a href="https://mashable.com/article/john-turturro-stanley-kubrick-eyes-wide-shut-story-severance-podcast" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Stanley Kubrick</a> manage to make shots of a <em>hallway</em> creepy? Well, by making those hallways feel not just scary, but more specifically, Uncanny.</p><p>These days, &ldquo;Uncanny&rdquo; is a concept used most often in discourse about robots and computer animation. <a href="https://mashable.com/video/here-trailer" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The Uncanny Valley</a>, I know you&rsquo;ve heard of it, or at least you know the feeling it evokes &mdash; The abject horror of <em>this</em> kid from The Polar Express, <em>good god, get him off the screen. </em>The Uncanny &mdash; capital T, Capital U, speaks to the fear of something that isn&rsquo;t <em>fully</em> unknown&hellip;it&rsquo;s unfamiliar, while retaining the elements of familiarity, and that tension causes a deep sense of unease. Returning to the Valley, think of those robots that move in a way that&rsquo;s slightly wrong, and suddenly, you feel unsafe, in danger, but you&rsquo;re not even sure exactly why. And this isn&rsquo;t confined to robots and animation, of course, lots of stuff can be described as Uncanny, including ghosts, doppelg&auml;ngers and mirrors, and can even be used to describe a human face. </p><p>Breaking it down, there&rsquo;s a throughline, here &mdash;&nbsp;we&rsquo;re being confronted with human or humanoid bodies not quite lining up with what we&rsquo;re expecting, pulling at fears of loss of identity, fears about mortality, fears of childhood nightmares suddenly becoming true&hellip;but let&rsquo;s take one step further, over the threshold from uncanny bodies to uncanny <em>places. </em>For example, have you ever been in a dead mall before? There should be people there. It&rsquo;s built for foot traffic and to allow noise to carry, but it&rsquo;s empty, silent, falling apart. There&rsquo;s nothing dangerous there, but it feels terrible to be there, it feels <em>off</em>.</p><p>Kubrick leaned all the way in on this feeling with <em>The Shining</em>, which is set in a hotel that&rsquo;s closed for the season. The halls and sitting rooms are empty &mdash; <em>too</em> empty. It&rsquo;s disquieting from the jump because this just isn&rsquo;t what a hotel is supposed to look like, to feel like. But sure, lots of movies are set in creepy old houses, but The Overlook Hotel isn&rsquo;t <em>creepy</em>, at least on its face. There <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> cobwebs and creaky floorboards and disjointed architecture that distinguish the classic haunted house. Instead, Kubrick decided to make the Overlook as real as possible, by sending out photographers to capture hundreds of pictures of real hotel halls and rooms and elevators, then picking the ones he found most interesting or evocative to build his sets from, replicating them down to the inch. Literally, they photographed the spaces with rulers in frame to make sure they were fully to scale. The Red Bathroom where Jack meets Grady: that was a real bathroom, created one-to-one on a soundstage in England. The fact that all of these spaces are clean, mundane, and downright <em>normal</em> just makes the discomfort all the more pronounced, because they feel like spaces we are familiar with. But something is clearly wrong in this hotel, and we just can&rsquo;t put our finger on what that wrongness is. </p><p>It&rsquo;s been 45 years, but the vibes of The Overlook are still a phenomenon. So sure, the lady in the tub is pretty scary, as are the twins. But at least for us, the most memorable bits of this movie are the long shots tracking through the hallways, the echoing emptiness of the Colorado Lounge, the unshakeable feeling of wrongness that The Overlook Hotel brings by simply being normal, and not, all at once. </p><p>What do you think? Does <em>The Shining</em> still give you nightmares, or has it gotten dated, at least as an entry in the horror genre? Let us know in the comments!</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04iNP22NOmiPvuhpwOkxE6c/hero-image.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy XR"><p>Samsung's long-awaited "Project Moohan" headset finally arrived earlier this week. The virtual reality headset dropped the codename and is now officially known as the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/project-moohan-samsung-xr-headset-launch-specs-pricing" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Samsung Galaxy XR</u></a>.</p><p>If you're in the market for a VR headset, you might have noticed that it's starting to get pretty crowded now. Meta Quest 3 has so far managed to dominate the space and is the toughest competitor to beat, thanks to a somewhat reasonable price tag. However, the Apple Vision Pro has carved out its own mixed-reality niche, despite the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/apple-vision-pro-software-sales-fec324c0" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AR/VR headset's well-documented struggles</a>.</p><p>Now, there's a new option: The Samsung Galaxy XR. How does it stack up? Mashable already <a href="https://mashable.com/article/samsung-galaxy-xr-vs-meta-quest-3-specs-price" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>pitted it against Meta's headset</u></a>. Now, let's look at how Samsung's new VR headset compares to the Apple Vision Pro specifications, pricing, and feature set.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy XR vs. Apple Vision Pro: Price</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">

<p>Samsung Galaxy XR looked like the premium option when stacked up against the $499 starting price of the Meta Quest 3. Coming in at $1,799.99, the Samsung Galaxy XR is certainly not cheap.</p><p>However, when compared to the Apple Vision Pro, the Samsung Galaxy XR swaps positions and looks like the budget option. The Apple Vision Pro starts at a whopping $3,499, making it nearly double the price of the Samsung Galaxy XR.</p><p>Again, neither are cheap. The Meta Quest 3's price point makes it much more accessible to most consumers, though its specs pale in comparison to the Galaxy XR and Vision Pro. However, the Samsung Galaxy XR fits in pretty neatly right between the massive price gap that exists between Meta's headset and Apple's headset.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy XR vs. Apple Vision Pro: Specs</h2><p>Both the Vnew M5 Vision Pro and Samsung Galaxy XR are premium products, but Samsung wins out in some key ways. It actually has superior displays, with 4,032 pixels per inch, compared to Apple's  3,386 PPI. On top of that, Samsung's headset is lighter.</p><p>Of course, the Vision Pro has something else &mdash; that signature Apple design and the visionOS interface.</p><p>Here are the basic specs for the Samsung Galaxy XR:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Two 4K micro-OLED displays with 3552x3840 resolution per eye, 29 million pixels, and up to 90Hz refresh rate&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chipset&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>109-degree horizontal, 100-degree vertical field of view&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Eye tracking and iris recognition included&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>256GB storage&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>16GB RAM&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>545g weight</p></li></ul><p>Apple just released the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-vision-pro-m5-announcement" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>latest version of the Apple Vision Pro</u></a> with the M5 chip. Here are the specs for its basic model:</p><ul><li><p>Dual Micro-OLED displays with 23 million pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate</p></li><li><p>M5 chip (10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine) and the R1 chip for low latency</p></li><li><p>Stereoscopic 3D main camera system with multiple world-facing and eye-tracking cameras</p></li><li><p>256GB storage</p></li><li><p>16GB RAM</p></li><li><p>600g weight</p></li></ul><p>Breaking this down a bit further, display-wise the Apple Vision Pro has the better refresh rate but the Samsung Galaxy XR provides a clearer picture with more pixels.</p><p>Operating systems will also come into play here when comparing the two. The Samsung Galaxy XR is the first headset to utilize Google&rsquo;s Android XR operating system. If you're an Android user already, that familiarity may be a welcome addition to a VR headset. However, the Android XR won't be unique to the Samsung Galaxy XR. Other headset manufacturers will also use Google's new operating system. On the flip side, much like Apple's other products and their respective operating systems, the Apple Vision Pro's visionOS will only be found on Apple's headset.</p><p>But, perhaps the most distinctive spec comes to what's powering the devices. While the Samsung Galaxy XR's Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chipset is very powerful, it is made for mobile. When it comes to the Apple Vision Pro, regardless of whether you have the M2 version or the more powerful M5, you're still using a headset with a chipset made for Apple's Mac computers. Either the M2 or M5 will provide significantly more processing power to the Apple Vision Pro than what the Galaxy XR's Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 can.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy XR vs. Apple Vision Pro: Controls</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Both the Apple Vision Pro and Samsung Galaxy XR use a tracking system built into the headset that tracks both the user's eyes and hands. This allows the user to control the device without the need for a controller, which is often required for other headsets such as the Meta Quest 3.</p><p>However, the Samsung Galaxy XR also has a dual controller option, which the Apple Vision Pro lacks. This might be preferable for gamers who are used to utilizing controllers.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy XR vs. Apple Vision Pro: Battery</h2><p>Neither Apple nor Samsung has managed to figure out something new and revolutionary with what to do about a VR headset's battery pack.</p><p>Both offer a battery that's separate from the headset itself. This is likely due to how uncomfortable it would be to wear either company's headset for significant periods of time with the battery adding extra weight. So, both the Samsung Galaxy XR and Apple Vision Pro require users to lug the extra equipment around.</p><p>Battery life for both devices is also quite similar. Samsung says that the Galaxy XR headset can be used for up to 2 hours of general use. As much as an extra 30 minutes can be added to the battery life if the device is just used for video playback. The Apple Vision Pro with the M2 chip also has a battery that can support up to 2 hours of general use and 2.5 hours of video playback.</p><p>However, there is a small difference with the Apple Vision Pro with the M5 chip. The latest version of the Vision Pro extends battery life so that it supports up to 2.5 hours of general use and up to 3 hours of video playback.</p><div class="flex relative flex-col p-6 mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans border border-gray-100 md:flex-row pogoClear">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/04Z2N9TpFdc6TZsB0Ldvock/hero-image.jpg" alt="illustration of two women meeting at a bar"><p>If you've chatted with any single friend lately or scrolled through social media, you know the general consensus: People are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dating-app-fatigue-has-led-to-a-flurry-of-irl-singles-events" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">exhausted by online dating</a>. The "app fatigue" is real, and it makes finding a genuine connection online feel impossible. As someone who's been testing and reviewing dating apps for years, I get asked one question constantly: Which apps actually work?</p><p>My answer is always the same: The only "hack" that works is choosing the right app for what you actually want. Someone on <a href="https://mashable.com/review/eharmony-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">eharmony</a> is looking for something different than a user on <a href="https://mashable.com/review/tinder-platinum-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tinder</a>. That's why I've put in the hours, the swipes, and the subscription fees to find the best options for every kind of single person.</p><p>Remember: A 2023 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/02/key-findings-about-online-dating-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pew Research Center report</a> found that one in 10 partnered adults met their significant other on a dating app, and the numbers are even higher for young people. More recently, the 2025 <a href="https://ssrs.com/insights/the-public-and-online-dating-in-2025/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">SSRS Opinion Panel Omnibus</a> found that 65 percent of people aged 18-29 have used a dating app. Countless connections truly have been sparked online, so to help you find your match, these are the best dating apps worth downloading in 2025.</p><p><em> If you need even more personalized advice, check out our guides to the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-men" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best dating apps for men</a></em><em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-women" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">women</a></em><em>, and the <a href="https://mashable.com/category/lgbtq" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">LGBTQ community</a></em><em>.</em></p><h3>The dating apps I'd skip (and why)</h3><p>You'll probably notice a few popular apps are missing from my list. That&rsquo;s intentional. Part of my job is to filter out the platforms that aren't worth your time, money, or sanity. An app doesn't get my recommendation just because it's well-known &mdash; it has to be effective and safe. </p><p>Here are a few popular dating apps I'd skip:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Plenty of Fish (POF):</strong> I know this one shows up on a lot of lists, but in my opinion, it's a dating app ghost town. POF launched as a dating site back in 2003, and it shows. In my experience (and based on widespread user feedback), the platform is filled with bots and scams, and the odds of finding a quality connection are stacked against you. Unless you enjoy sifting through fake profiles, I think your time is better spent elsewhere.</p></li><li><p><strong>Raya:</strong> Raya is basically the Soho House of dating apps. It's exclusive, expensive, and not for the average person. You have to fill out an application to use it, and the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/exclusive-dating-apps-raya-the-league-lox-club" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">vetting process</a> can take anywhere from a few days to a few years. While it might be great for networking or bagging an influencer, it's just <a href="https://mashable.com/article/raya-dating-app-is-not-as-exclusive-as-you-think-it-is" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">not a practical recommendation</a> for most people who are simply looking for a date. (See also: The League.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Niche "hookup" sites (like BeNaughty, Fling, etc.): </strong>There's a chance you've seen ads for sites like these, which promise quick, no-strings-attached fun. Based on my research and countless user reviews, I'd advise you to steer clear. These platforms are notorious for being overrun with bots and having questionable billing practices, with users reporting unexpected and hard-to-cancel subscription charges. </p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

Evidence from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-are-shooting-stars" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>meteorites</u></a>, the rocky <a href="https://mashable.com/category/space" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>space</u></a> debris that falls to Earth, shows two distinct generations of these planet-building supplies. Though the first group formed quickly, within the first million years, the second group, which produced the rocky blocks closer to Earth, Mars, and Venus, didn&rsquo;t form until 2 or 3 million years later. How enough dust remained to make this second wave of material, though, has been a mystery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To find out, researchers ran detailed computer simulations of the young solar system. The <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ady4823#sec-3" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>results</u></a>, which appear in the journal <em>Science Advances</em>, point to Jupiter &mdash; whose mass today is more than double that of all the other planets combined &mdash; as the key player.&nbsp;Prior to this study, a model didn't exist that could fully account for the age gap in the ancient planet-building material. This research may be the first to combine <a href="https://mashable.com/article/jupiter-original-size-twice-as-big" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>how Jupiter grew</u></a>, dust moved, and asteroids formed into one explanation.</p><p>Not only did the gas giant play a pivotal role in keeping Earth and its neighbors from migrating more inward, but it probably stunted their growth, too, cutting off their access to material from the outer part of the solar system, said Baibhav Srivastava, a planetary scientist and one of the study's authors.</p><p>"Our Earth might have become a 'super-Earth,'" Srivastava told Mashable. "This may have significant implications for the potential habitability of Earth as well, since it may have left the 'Goldilocks' zone of the solar system."</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>As the giant planet grew, it reshaped the sun's surroundings, according to the study. It drained gas from the inner region and created ridges of higher pressure that effectively fenced in dust and formed ring-like clumps of material. These "dust traps" allowed new solid objects to form long after the original ones, naturally explaining the age gap of the rocky space material. The timing of this second wave matches that of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meteorite-shooting-star-flavor" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>ordinary chondrites</u></a>, the most commonly found type of stony meteorite on Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>Scientists have estimated the ages of meteorites' parent bodies by measuring tiny amounts of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-mars-habitability-curiosity-rover" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>isotopes</u></a>, particular forms of elements, inside them. Because some isotopes are radioactive, they slowly change into other elements at a predictable rate. By comparing how much of the original isotope remains to how much has decayed, researchers can calculate when the rock solidified. It's similar to carbon dating ancient bones or wood on Earth, but with heavier elements, such as lead, rubidium, and strontium, Srivastava explained.</p><p>By the time the second generation of rocky material solidified, Earth was already forming, so they likely didn't contribute much to the planet.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>But the model supports the idea that Jupiter's birth must have come extremely early, within the first 2 million years of the solar system. That gave the young planet time to shape and structure the rest of the available gas and dust around the sun.</p><p>The findings mirror what astronomers now observe with powerful telescopes in other emerging star systems, said Andr&eacute; Izidoro, a Rice assistant professor and author of the study.</p><p>"Looking at those young disks, we see the beginning of giant planets forming and reshaping their birth environment," Izidoro said in <a href="https://news.rice.edu/news/2025/rice-planetary-scientists-link-jupiters-birth-earths-formation-zone" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>a statement</u></a>.

<p>However, the true heart of this moving film is a subtle, sensitive performance by Joel Edgerton, one immersed in Bryce Dessner's meticulous score and Adolpho Veloso's lush cinematography, and concluded with the unmistakable spirit of Nick Cave.</p><h2>What is <em>Train Dreams</em> about?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Beginning in 1917 and running through to 1968, <em>Train Dreams</em> follows a man's search for meaning as the 20th century arrives. The Wild West days are over. The American frontier is transforming. And Edgerton leads as devoted family man and stoic railroad worker Robert Grainier, who works for the Spokane International Railway in Idaho. He builds transient bonds with his fellow lumberjacks and pines for home. He's also a man riddled by guilt for his complicity watching the racist murder of a Chinese immigrant worker during a railroad job, perpetually haunted by the memory. Here, the script diverges from the novella: In the latter, Robert physically helps in hauling the worker to a tall bridge, but in the film, Robert simply doesn't intervene.</p><p>Despite this shockingly casual event, the film spends most of its time tracing Robert's life. After a brief courtship with his soon-to-be wife Gladys Olding (Felicity Jones), in the small village of Meadow Creek, Robert builds a simple, idyllic home with her among fields of wildflowers and beside a babbling brook. The pair map out their single-room cabin with river boulders and soon welcome the arrival of their daughter Kate. It's an almost overwhelmingly romantic existence, hammered home in near-saccharine montages and Dessner's tender score, and one Robert yearns for when torn away for months on dangerous railroad-building projects. The job's perils are emphasised in both Johnson's novella and Bentley's film, with injury or death from the felling of colossal trees a common workplace risk for 20th-century lumberjacks. Veloso's POV shots of these ancient giants falling prove the point, and several scenes show how risky this business of pillaging the natural landscape was.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>At one tragic point, in a devastatingly shot and enacted sequence, Robert's world is upturned forever. He's left desperately searching for meaning in it all, feeling obsolete and expecting "a great revelation to arrive about his life." Edgerton delivers a solemn, raw performance &mdash; and with everything that happens, we're not mad that he's surrounded by fluffy stray puppies for a large chunk of the film. Giving Edgerton's character room for deep conversation and reflection, Bentley and Kwedar expand characters from Johnson's book, including Robert's friend Ignatius Jack (a wonderful Nathaniel Arcand), a Kootenai store owner who helps him rebuild, and forest service worker Claire (Kerry Condon), who bonds with Robert down the track.</p><h2><em>Train Dreams</em> is a journey of solitude and American history.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Though it's not necessarily a history lesson, <em>Train Dreams</em> subtly meanders through stories of the American West and where these unsung railroad workers fit within it. Through an omniscient narrator (voiced by Will Patton) and conversations between characters, the script pieces together fragments of the past. As in Johnson's novella, mentions of the American Civil War, American Indian Wars, and World War I arise organically. In particular here, William H. Macy is a highlight as Arn Peeples, a harmonica-playing explosives expert and "gadabout of unknown origin" who befriends Robert. As in the novella, Arn's the character most reflective on American history, lamenting his younger peers' disconnection to it.</p><p>Like Arn, Patton's narration lends a certain grandfatherly energy, describing locomotive mechanics, the construction of the Robinson Gorge Bridge, and "the cost of progress" in the same tone as he describes Robert's existential crisis. Nonetheless, it gives the film a steadfast emotional consistency. Additionally, his narration gives the film's present an awareness of the future, as we learn what will become of things.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>Train Dreams</em> also takes pains to capture a specific tension between tradition and modernity through the work of production designer Alexandra Schaller. From the handcrafted elements of the Graniers' cabin to the changing technology of the logging sites from rudimentary tools to machinery, Schaller's team craft a detailed picture of life in the American West from early to mid century.

<p>Adding to his lauded catalogue of modern film scores from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu-guillermo-del-toro-oscars-wall" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Revenant</u></em></a> to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/we-live-in-time-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>We Live In Time</u></em></a>, The National's Bryce Dessner once again flexes his atmospheric composer skills in <em>Train Dreams</em>. At once a whimsical, romantic ode to potential and a hypnotic, reflective accompaniment to loss, Dessner's score drives the emotional engine of <em>Train Dreams</em>. Edgerton's Robert is characteristically stoic and interior in his emotions, allowing Dessner to draw out the brilliant subtleties of his performance. Meanwhile, it's the perfect partner to Veloso's gorgeous shots of Robert engulfed by the Idaho landscape, immersed in the beauty and history of the American wilderness.</p><p>Worth staying through the film's end credits for, Dessner teams up with the ever-iconic Nick Cave (no stranger to a lyrical exploration of love and loss) for the haunting original song "Train Dreams." This brooding ballad essentially encapsulates the film's narrative and emotional tone in a few minutes, marking a sublime conclusion to the film.</p><p><em>Train Dreams </em>takes its time, relishing in conversations about grief, loss, feeling obsolete and overwhelmed by both nature and modernity. This slower pace can feel a little engulfing at times, but Edgerton's performance, Dessner's score, and Veloso's balance of handheld and static photography kept me hitched on the ride.</p><p><em>Train Dreams</em> was reviewed out of BFI London Film Festival.

<p>Screen time management apps can be great for ensuring you only spend a certain amount of time on social media a day, but there's a big issue &mdash; they're easy to bypass. Using my iPhone's built-in app limits, I quickly fell into the habit of sneaking in one more minute of TikTok, which then became another hour. Brick is also an app, but it adds a physical component, too, which takes away the easy bypass.</p><p>The Brick works by locking certain apps when you tap your phone to the Brick. To unlock your phone, you have to tap it against the Brick again. However, if you're in a pinch and really need to access your blocked apps without getting up to tap your phone, the Brick app has five emergency un-Bricks available in total. A word of caution, though, once you've used up these emergency un-Bricks, you have to factory reset your device to make them available again, so use them sparingly.</p><p>Previously, the Brick was only available on iOS devices; however, it's now also available on Android smartphones. Multiple devices can be used per Brick, too. My wife and I use the same Brick, keeping it on our refrigerator for easy access.</p><h2>It's the only thing to truly get my screen time down</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Having the physical component of the Brick means that if you want to access your blocked apps, you can't just press a button. You have to get up and go to your Brick to tap your phone.</p><p>And let me tell you, that small physical element makes a world of difference. When I'm lounging on the couch in the evening and want to scroll through Instagram, even though I'm already watching a show, knowing I'd have to get up to un-Brick my phone is enough to deter me from scrolling. My favorite use of Bricking my phone is before bed, as it ensures social media isn't the first thing I see when I wake up and forces me to get out of bed if I do want to look at it.</p><p>Plus, the Brick has given me my attention back. When I Brick my phone, it takes away the distraction so I'm not watching my phone when I should be watching TV. But the Brick is even great when I'm not trying to focus on something else. With all my most distracting apps blocked, I'm finally bored again. When I have some downtime, rather than defaulting to scrolling, it motivates me to spend more time reading or finally tackle those errands I've been putting off.</p><h2>It cut my screen time in half</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl">

<p>So what was the result of my using the Brick? It cut my screen time in half.</p><p>The best way to quantify the effectiveness of the Brick is through numbers. Before using the Brick, I was averaging about six hours of phone screen time a day. I didn't set out to limit my screen time by a certain number or percentage; I just wanted it to be less. So I was shocked when using the Brick cut my screen time down to an average of three hours a day. Yup, a whole 50 percent less.</p><p>Additionally, my whole household has adopted the Brick to limit screen time. I work from home, so I have to exercise a little discipline when I don't have in-person coworkers around. But even my wife, who teaches every day, Bricks their phone before heading to school every morning.</p><h2>You can create different modes</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Bricking your phone isn't an all-or-nothing decision. The default setting allows you to block all apps &mdash; including your texts and video calls &mdash; making it essentially a dumb phone that only allows you to make standard phone calls. However, that's not your only option. You can create different modes, hand-selecting which apps to allow or which to block.</p><p>I've created some modes that make my phone similar to a dumb phone &mdash; except I do allow for video calls and texts. However, other modes I've created just block the apps that are my biggest distractions: Instagram, TikTok, X, Pinterest, and even Chrome. I also have a light version of this, which helps me stay distraction-free during work but still allows me access to Chrome in case I need to look something up.</p><h2>Be careful about what apps you select</h2><p>My only word of caution regarding the Brick is to check which apps get blocked. If you select the option to block all apps, that can end up preventing you access to apps that you might actually need. One time, I Bricked my phone before heading to the gym, only to realize that it was blocking my gym's app, which has my membership card. Another time, my Brick was blocking the Amazon app, which I needed to scan at Whole Foods to get extra savings.</p><p>Luckily, that's where Brick's emergency un-Bricking feature helps. Unfortunately, I've already used up two of the allotted five.</p><h2>I wish it set app limits</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>One thing I do like about Apple's built-in screen time is that you can set app limits. Unfortunately, you can't set app limits with Brick. Instead, you just block all apps to try and cut back on your overall screen time. While I quickly adapted to Brick's system, I occasionally missed the app limits that would give me a cue that it was time to ditch social media for the evening.</p><h2>It's a bit of an investment</h2><p>Going from using a free screen time feature on my iPhone to paying $59 for The Brick is a little tough to stomach. That being said, it really works. It's the only system that's been able to effectively decrease my screen time. Plus, it's a one-time price to pay.</p><p>Other popular screen time apps, like Opal, have free versions, but to access all features, you'll need to pay $99.99 per year.</p><h2>Is the Brick worth it?</h2><div class="flex relative flex-col p-6 mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans border border-gray-100 md:flex-row pogoClear">

If you've been looking for a system to reduce your screen time and have found that built-in app limits aren't enough, the Brick is my favorite option.</p><p>The physical limitation of the Brick adds an extra barrier, making it especially effective at preventing you from overriding your screen time and staying truly distraction-free.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the best examples of AI image generation at work is to blend pictures together. To make it work, simply upload two images to the ChatGPT chat with instructions on what you want to do. For this example, I took a headshot of myself and a picture of my dog with his nose on the table, and asked ChatGPT to put my head in the image with the dog. The goal was as you see above, to have a picture of my dog and I together.&nbsp;</p><p>The first time I tried it, it took my head and not my shoulders, so I had a real <em>Futurama</em> thing going where I was just a head floating there, so I had ChatGPT rerun the generation with specific instructions to also include my shoulders. The above popped out, and while it doesn&rsquo;t look exactly like me (and the dog doesn&rsquo;t look exactly like my dog), it&rsquo;s close enough to call a success.&nbsp;</p><h2>Turn yourself (or your pets) into trading cards</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>This one was really fun to do. I used a picture of my dog Luna, who sadly passed away last year. I had ChatGPT create this playing card for an imaginary fantasy role-playing game, which I&rsquo;ll use as a cute social media post eventually. I uploaded a photo of my dog and used a prompt detailing what I wanted.</p><p><em>"This is a good dog named Luna. Please create a playing card featuring Luna for an imaginary fantasy role-playing game. The card should feature details on HP, attack name and effect, weaknesses (tennis balls, peanut butter), and a very brief description of Luna's abilities. Before completing the card, double-check that all words, text, and numbers appear correctly without any mistakes or typos." </em></p><p>These make for delightful little images that you can share, and my wife got a giggle out of it. There are a ton of variations to this prompt. You can also have ChatGPT create sports trading cards or whatever your heart desires.</p><h2>Add details to existing images</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>ChatGPT can also add stuff to images to make them pop more.

So, I thought I&rsquo;d try it out. Last year, the U.S.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/aurora-light-shows-could-brighten-up-skies-all-week-where-to-watch-them/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>saw a crazy week</u></a>&nbsp;where the aurora borealis reached as far as Texas. I caught a picture from my front yard, but as I was in the suburbs, and I wasn&rsquo;t able to get those cool details that others did.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I sent the picture to ChatGPT and asked it to add in some of those aurora details. In the image above, ChatGPT added basically all the green parts to the sky. The more subtle green notes right above the trees and houses are perfect, but I thought the more obvious green waves were a bit much considering the lighting and color tones of the rest of the photograph. Either way, it still looks good, and it illustrates the effect.&nbsp;</p><p>For prompts like this, be as specific as possible.

ChatGPT will then turn your pet into a human.&nbsp;However, it's also fun to keep this prompt extremely simple and see how ChatGPT interprets it: <em>"Turn my pet into a human."</em></p><div class="raw-embed">

<p>When Mashable's tech editor asked ChatGPT to replicate an image of himself 100 times, the results were... bizarre. For this trend, most people stick with a very simple prompt: <em>"Create an exact replica of this image, don't change a thing."</em></p><p>You would think it would just spit out the same image 100 times, but you would be wrong. Every time you run an image through ChatGPT, it changes slightly, even if you tell it not to change anything. Repeat this a bunch of times, and you can get some <a href="https://mashable.com/article/chatgpt-viral-image-replication-trend-100x" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">really interesting end results</a>. Word of warning: This one does require a bit more know-how, as the easiest and fastest way is to it is by using OpenAI&rsquo;s API. The everyday AI chatbot may even refuse to participate in a replication request.</p><div class="redditEmbed reddit">

<p>One of the most famous examples of this ChatGPT image trend is one where a Redditor ran Dwayne &ldquo;The Rock&rdquo; Johnson's picture through the chatbot 101 times. The Rock slowly morphs from himself into someone who looks totally different, and ends up looking like something out of Picasso&rsquo;s nightmares. </p><h2>Turn yourself (or anything else) into an action figure</h2><p>Remember the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ai-action-figured-trend-what-it-is-how-to-make-one" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ChatGPT action figure trend</a>? Earlier this year, ChatGPT users were using the chatbot to turn themselves or their favorite characters into action figures, complete with packaging, plastic wrap, and accessories. For best results, add some details to your prompt about the packaging details and the sort of accessories you'd like to see to further customize the final result. </p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">

It most often still is, despite the fact that many marginalized people gravitate toward horror because the genre allows us to process trauma from the safe distance of fiction.</p><p>Increasingly, horror films are proving themselves to be a perfect genre for social commentary, to understand the Other rather than demonize them.</p><q>
    Until we allow a fuller spectrum of women to be both the creators and subjects of horror films, we cannot truly say that feminism has reclaimed the genre from all its gatekeepers.
    </q>
<p>So in the spirit of Halloween, we've compiled an exhaustive (though undoubtedly incomplete) guide to the best feminist and women-centric horror films of all time. But our comprehensive list comes with a million caveats. </p><p>Namely, giving these titles the moniker of "feminist" is imperfect at best when so many of them continue to marginalize queer, trans, Black, Indigenous, and other women of color's experiences &mdash; along with propagating ageist, fatphobic, racist, and ableist tropes.</p><p>Not only is the filmography of feminist horror dominated by straight, white, thin, cis able-bodied feminism, but a <em>lot</em> of the movies are still written and/or directed by men. To the genre's credit, though, it does often give more women and marginalized filmmakers opportunities than, say, more "respected" genres. Also, a lot of feminist horror, especially those directed by women, were held back by the Hollywood machine, sometimes resulting in more muddled messaging than creators intended.</p><p>That said, feminist films do not have to be perfect to do great things (nor should we expect them to be). Holding them to higher standards doesn't mean we can't appreciate what progress they do make, either. But until we allow a fuller spectrum of women to be both the creators and subjects of horror films, we cannot truly say that feminism has reclaimed the genre from all its gatekeepers.</p><h2>1. <em>Prevenge</em> (2017)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>This cheeky UK indie masterpiece is truly the mother of all horror-comedies. Ruth, a very pregnant and grieving single mom, commits violent murders at the behest of her killer fetus. With salient commentary on motherhood and society's misogynistic expectations of pregnant women, <em>Prevenge</em> has it all.

The werewolf-as-puberty metaphor is a well-mined one, but the iconic goth sisters of this film capture something undeniably relatable in using it specifically to explore experiences of girlhood.</p><p><strong>Where to watch: </strong><em>Ginger Snaps</em> is now streaming on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbM8Pe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Peacock&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=QbM8Pe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Peacock</a>,<strong> </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/o7wPL?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Shudder&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=o7wPL&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Shudder</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/98PAr2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AMC%2B&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=98PAr2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AMC+</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJr83q?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Tubi&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=zJr83q&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tubi</a> for free with ads, and is available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLMpxX?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=QLMpxX&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple TV</a>.</p><h2>4. <em>Raw</em> (2016)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>A girl&rsquo;s gotta eat, but <em>Raw</em> takes the term "man-eater" to a whole new level. This striking art house coming-of-age horror from writer-director Julia Ducournau explores the complex relationships women have with sexuality, food, consumption, and each other. It's not for the faint of stomach, but it's more visually arresting than needlessly gore-y if you ask us.

<p>The quintessential horror-as-feminist-theory allegory, the original <em>Stepford Wives</em> was a seminal influence on socially conscious horror, with Jordan Peele naming it as a major inspiration for <em>Get Out</em>.

<p>A groundbreaking, gorgeous southern gothic, the ever-present loom of sexism and racism haunt the women protagonists of <em>Eve&rsquo;s Bayou</em> &mdash; though they find a way to embody Black girl magic anyway. Legendary writer-director Kasi Lemmons (who earlier won an Oscar for <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>) grounds the film in Black women&rsquo;s experiences, particularly through the young (now Emmy award&mdash;winning) Jurnee Smollett as she wrestles with memories and traumas, both personal and communal. </p><p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> <em>Eve's Bayou</em> is now streaming on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGr8x8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Peacock&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=QGr8x8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Peacock</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wjB2b?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=9wjB2b&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Video</a>, and is available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/9212jE?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=9212jE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple TV</a>.</p><h2>7. <em>Revenge</em> (2018)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>Seemingly a more traditional coroner's office horror, this thriller flips the script on the beautiful female victim narrative in the most delicious way possible. We debated where to include a film where the woman with the most time on screen is dead the whole time.

<p>Spotlighting exactly what is so lacking in the popular conception and understanding of horror, this essential documentary based on Robin R. Means Coleman's book lays out the centuries-long intersection between Blackness and horror. From the Black-made horror films that have been all but erased from public access to re-framing <em>Birth of a Nation</em> as part of the genre, it shows how Black people (especially women) are a much bigger part of horror's greatness than the white mainstream gives them credit for.</p><p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> <em>Horror Noire: A History of Black Horror</em> is now streaming on<strong> </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/gM8Lb?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Shudder&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=gM8Lb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Shudder</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKq8mE?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AMC%2B&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=QKq8mE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AMC+</a>, and is available for purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31OqV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=z31OqV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple TV</a>. </p><h2>15. <em>The Love Witch</em> (2017)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>The "well, actually" horror fans will likely want to challenge characterizing <em>Love Witch</em> as a horror movie. But that might be because writer/director Anna Biller bucks any form of conventionality, presenting a sumptuous vision of the woman's gaze rarely allowed to flourish in film, horror, or otherwise. An homage as much as a subversion, <em>The Love Witch</em> is also a more subtle example of comedic horror than others on this list.

Betty Friedan's seminal <em>Feminine Mystique</em> book absolutely drips off the screen, almost to the point where references are a bit overdone. But ultimately <em>Swallow</em> is saved by a spectacular performance from Haley Bennett, a fantastic sense of cinematic tension, and an abundance of visual sumptuousness. </p><p><strong>Where to watch: </strong><em>Swallow</em> is now streaming on <a href="https://zdcs.link/82MyR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hulu&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=82MyR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Hulu</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdp8B5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=MUBI&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=Qdp8B5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MUBI</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBD8Rb?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AMC%2B&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=aBD8Rb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AMC+</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8Klg?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Shudder&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=aM8Klg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Shudder</a>, and is available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/YN742?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=YN742&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Video</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjXBB?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=9gjXBB&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple TV</a>. </p><h2>20. <em>Starry Eyes</em> (2014)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>This gothic arthouse ghost story is a masterpiece of uncanny disquiet. A live-in nurse arrives at a house haunted by the rot of feminine beauty. Visually stunning and tensely atmospheric, it's a slow burn straight to the heart. To quote our review, <em>I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House </em>is "one of Netflix's most daring experiments, and one of the most evocative atmospheric horror films exploring the female psyche since Polanksi's <em>Repulsion..</em>. The film's dream-like narrative emerges through the disparate yet intertwined lives (and deaths) of three women, all colliding under the same roof."

<p>Ready or Not isn't winning any "elevated horror" awards, but it doesn't need to. It's well-written, cathartic fun with not only a feminist but also socioeconomic bent.

<p>As much a cathartic break-up movie as it is a scary one, as joyful as it is terrifying, <em>Midsommar </em>is a gorgeous grotesquerie that thrives through contradiction. Like many on this list, it complicates the trope-y female empowerment horror film narrative by not painting it through rose-tinted glasses, and is relatable to any woman who's suffered through grief and dating a shitty dude.

<p>Where do we even begin? <em>Alien</em> is feminist horror 101, leading to decades of scholarly analysis into its psychosexual undertones. All we'll say is that it essentially entails about two hours of Sigourney Weaver surviving like a boss while fighting to save her pussy (protect Jonesy at all costs). Aside from being revolutionary for its time, few other classics from the genre have aged quite as gracefully, making it as gripping and evocative now as it was in the 1970s.</p><p><strong>Where to watch: </strong><em>Alien</em> is streaming on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKq8Y3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hulu&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=QKq8Y3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Hulu</a>, and is available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7MR67?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=z7MR67&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Video</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wjBVD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=9wjBVD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple TV</a>.</p><h2>34. <em>You're Next</em> (2011)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>Something about <em>The Little Mermaid</em> continues to enthrall our collective unconscious century after century, and it has a lot to do with its gender politics (for better and for worse). This Polish horror-musical genre-bender is closer to the darker original Hans Christian Anderson folktale than the Disney version. Depicting two mermaid sisters as carnivorous sirens rather than fantasies of the male gaze, director Agnieszka Smoczy&#324;skait's inspired vision nails the monster sympathy film.</p><p><strong>Where to watch: </strong><em>The Lure</em> is streaming on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrAJnG?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Criterion%20Collection&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=QrAJnG&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The Criterion Collection</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmO8b6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=HBO%20Max&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=QmO8b6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">HBO Max</a>, and is available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/6grK2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=6grK2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Video</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/RVOG7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=RVOG7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple TV</a>.</p><h2>37. <em>The Girl with All the Gifts</em> (2017)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>One of the few horror films in history to ever feature a young Black girl as the hero<em>, The Girl With All the Gifts </em>is a British zombie movie that bucks many of the subgenre's tropes. While the lead character was not written with any race specified, the captivating Sennia Nanua adds <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-girl-with-all-the-gifts-racebending-means-so-much-m-1792786423" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">groundbreaking layers of social commentary</a>.

<p>People with disabilities often get a really raw fucking deal in horror movies, appearing mostly through tropes that turn them into inhuman evil grotesqueries. While protagonist Maddie does not have a visible disability, she is deaf, and set up to appear as the perfect helpless victim for a predator.

<p>On its surface, <em>Relic</em> seems to deal in the misogynistic horror trope of older women's bodies as inherently grotesque, disgusting, or evil (looking at you, <em>The Witch</em> and more egregiously, <em>The Shining</em>). But first-time writer/director Natalie Erika James' debut film brings a previously unseen tenderness that subverts it, exploring the true horror of aging as having little to do with a woman's body. With one of the best final scenes in any horror movie, we highly recommend checking it out.</p><p><strong>Where to watch: </strong><em>Relic</em> is streaming on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPVxXD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Shudder&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=QPVxXD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Shudder</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/911wGx?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AMC%2B&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=911wGx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AMC+</a>, and<strong> </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/R5J6y?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=R5J6y&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Video</a>, and is available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXV4ox?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=02j29fQ4leCfdZM0fp8C5yI&short_url=aXV4ox&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple TV</a>. </p><h2>Honorable Mention: <em>Lovecraft Country</em> (2020)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>We know, we know. <em>Lovecraft Country</em> is a show, not a movie. That technicality is the only reason it doesn't qualify for our official list. But as one of the rare horror anything's to not only be spearheaded by a Black woman but that also centralizes Black women's perspectives across many ages and social circumstances, Misha Green's <em>Lovecraft Country</em> is a long overdue, vital leap forward in the feminist reclaiming of the horror genre we need to see much more of.

The cycle occurs when the angles between the Sun, Moon, and Earth change. Moon phases are how the moon looks from Earth as it goes around us. We always see the same side of the moon, but how much of it is lit up by the Sun changes depending on where it is in its orbit. This is how we get full moons, half moons, and moons that appear completely invisible. There are eight main moon phases, and they follow a repeating cycle.</p><p>The eight main moon phases are:</p><p>New Moon - The moon is between Earth and the sun, so the side we see is dark (in other words, it's invisible to the eye).</p><p>Waxing Crescent - A small sliver of light appears on the right side (Northern Hemisphere).</p><p>First Quarter - Half of the moon is lit on the right side. It looks like a half-moon.</p><p>Waxing Gibbous - More than half is lit up, but it&rsquo;s not quite full yet.</p><p>Full Moon - The whole face of the moon is illuminated and fully visible.</p><p>Waning Gibbous - The moon starts losing light on the right side. (Northern Hemisphere)</p><p>Third Quarter (or Last Quarter) - Another half-moon, but now the left side is lit.</p><p>Waning Crescent - A thin sliver of light remains on the left side before going dark again.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[We've lined up a selection of the best DSLR cameras for photography novices, including models from top brands like Canon and Nikon.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/02DTolideDFf8VJ7ijnTQ1x/hero-image.jpg" alt="hands holding a camera"><p>In the age of the smartphone, everybody's an amateur photographer. We have a camera on our person, tucked away in a pocket, pretty much all the time. But what about taking things a step further photography-wise? Why not buy a real camera and take a step towards going pro? You'll be amazed and the difference in image quality.</p><p>But what type of camera? In case you didn't know, you can choose from a "DSLR", "mirrorless", or "point-and-shoot" camera. We recommend a DSLR. After all, you already have a point-and-shoot camera on your phone. And a mirrorless, an increasingly popular choice, might be a bit tech-heavy for beginners. </p><p>Overall, it&rsquo;s important that you buy a camera that allows you to grow and gain confidence in your <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-online-courses-photography-online-portfolio-editing-uk" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">photography skills</a>. Ultimately, the best camera is the one that feels right in your hand. Not to mention a camera that you can actually use and isn't too complicated. Many amateur photographers start with DSLR cameras because DSLRs have multiple options, lenses, and classic handling. If it's all a bit new to you, here's some useful information and a selection of the best DSLR cameras for beginners.</p><h2>What is a DSLR camera?</h2><p>DSLR stands for <a href="https://expertphotography.com/what-does-dslr-stand-for/" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">digital single-lens reflex</a>. DSLRs are popular because of how easy they are to use and the multitude of lenses available. DSLRs have a mirror in the lens which  reflects the optical image into the camera's viewfinder &mdash; the photo is then captured on an SD card. Just to clear up any potential confusion: The difference between a DSLR and an SLR is mainly that SLR uses film while DSLR is all digital.</p><h2>Is mirrorless better than DSLR?</h2><p>As always, it's less about what's better and more about what suits you best &mdash; though the current trend does seem to be towards mirrorless, which is the more popular type of camera at the moment. Mirrorless cameras tend to be smaller and more compact (that's one of the big selling points). And though DSLRs are bulkier, they tend to have better battery life for this reason. Reviewers also talk about the "handling" of DSLR cameras &mdash; the classic feel of a chunky, grippable, easy-to-use camera.</p><p>The other differences to note are that DSLRs have a classic optical viewfinder, whereas mirrorless cameras have an electronic viewfinder or sometimes no viewfinder at all &mdash; they prioritise an LCD monitor for "live view" shooting instead. DSLRs have also implemented these monitors on the rear side, though that means DSLRs have two different autofocus systems for both viewfinder and monitor. </p><p>One benefit of DSLRs is the sheer number of lenses available, particularly from manufacturers that have been in the DSLR game for years, such as Canon and Nikon.</p><h2>Do DSLR cameras shoot video?</h2><p>One of the big differences between DSLR and mirrorless is that mirrorless cameras are better for shooting video. So, if video is a big priority for you, it might be worth picking up a mirrorless camera instead. However, the DSLRs in this roundup all shoot video &mdash; and some even capture 4K &mdash; so they're not exactly slouches on the video front.</p><h2>Are DSLRs good for beginners?</h2><p>DSLRs do have some advantages over mirrorless cameras. One thing worth noting is that because the mirror covers the sensor, it's protected against dust and dirt when you remove or change lenses. This makes cleaning a lot easier for beginners. And while DSLR cameras are bulkier and heavier than the new mirrorless options, pros and newbies alike will prefer the beefier construction and easy-to-use tools.</p><h2>How much does a DSLR camera cost?</h2><p>DSLR cameras with a built-in viewfinder are the cheapest option within this category, and you can expect a basic set up complete with <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-cameras-for-vlogging-uk" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">camera</a>, zoom lens, and carrying case to run you anywhere from &pound;300 to &pound;2,000. </p><h2>What is the best DSLR camera for beginners?</h2><p>We've checked out everything on offer for beginners, and lined up the very best DSLR cameras from top brands. There should be something for everyone and every budget in this list. You just need to pick the model that best fits your requirements.</p><p>These are the best DSLR cameras for beginners in 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer.</p><p>If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple.

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>What is <em>Connections: Sports Edition</em>?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has launched in association with <em>The Athletic</em>, the New York Times property that provides the publication's sports coverage. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-october-17-2025" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" title="(Opens in a new tab)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer.</p><p>If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake &mdash; players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Lanthimos' dark comedy about a conspiracy theorist who kidnaps a high-powered CEO comes with its fair share of twists and turns. Its ending in particular seems designed to shock, although Lanthimos and screenwriter Will Tracy do plant their fair share of hints at what's coming. Let's break it down.</p><h2>How does <em>Bugonia </em>end?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Based on the 2003 South Korean film <em>Save the Green Planet!</em>, <em>Bugonia </em>sees beekeeper Teddy (Jesse Plemons) and his cousin Donny (Aidan Delbis) take pharmaceutical CEO Michelle (Emma Stone) hostage. They believe that she is an Andromedan alien who was sent to infiltrate humanity and make them subservient to alien rule. By <em>Bugonia</em>'s end, Lanthimos reveals that Teddy was right... kind of.</p><p>That's right: Michelle is actually an Andromedan. More than that, she's the Andromedan empress.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The revelation comes on the night of the lunar eclipse, which is when Teddy believes the Andromedan mothership will arrive near Earth. Michelle manages to get Teddy to the headquarters of her company, Auxolith, where she claims that the closet in her office is actually a transporter that will beam the pair of them to the mothership. Things quickly go awry when Teddy shows Michelle that he's wearing a suicide vest as insurance. Moments later, the vest detonates in reaction to his body heat.</p><p>If you believe that Michelle is a human, the entire Auxolith scene feels like her stalling for time in order to get help from outside authorities. However, in the chaos that follows Teddy's death, it turns out that that isn't the case at all. Michelle drags herself from an ambulance back to her office, where she does, in fact, get transported to the Andromedan mothership.</p><h2>What did the Andromedans want with Earth?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>So yes, Teddy was correct about Michelle being an Andromedan. He was also correct about her hair being how she could communicate with her ship, and about her being a member of the imperial bloodline. (Of course, he missed that she was the <em>actual </em>emperor.) Still, he was far off on the reason the Andromedans were truly on Earth.</p><p>Right before Michelle and Teddy head to Auxolith for the last time, Michelle discovers Teddy's experiments on dead bodies, some of whom were Andromedan, some of whom were human. At this point, Michelle quits pretending to be human (or pretending to be a human claiming she's an alien in order to satisfy her captor) and tells Teddy the story of the Andromedan race. They arrived on Earth millions of years ago, accidentally killing dinosaurs in the process. From there, they created humans in their own image. That prompted the creation of the ancient civilization of Atlantis.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>However, as humans turned on one another and engaged in devastating wars, the Andromedans grew horrified at their own offspring. According to Michelle, Auxolith's experiments &mdash; including the drugs that put Teddy's mother Sandy (Alicia Silverstone) in a coma &mdash; were intended to find a way to help humanity and continue their evolution. However, those experiments ended up failing. Ironically, in the end, by trying to save humans from aliens, Teddy actually dooms them, as his kidnapping and torture of Michelle prove to be the last straw for the aliens' patience. Michelle, now back on the mothership (and sporting a massive hair headpiece), decrees that humans cannot be saved. With one pop of a bubble encasing the Andromedans' model of Earth, she wipes out every human on the planet. It's a bleak conclusion for humans but not for Earth: In the film's final moments, bees begin to flourish again.</p><p><em>Don&rsquo;t miss out on our latest stories: <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=mashable.com" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Add Mashable as a trusted news source in Google</a></em><em>.</em></p><h2>Wait, is <em>Bugonia </em>saying that conspiracy theorists are right?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>Bugonia</em>'s reveal that Michelle has been an Andromedan all along gives the film killer rewatch value, especially when it comes to Stone's performance and the many layers of deception Michelle is balancing. However, does it also risk legitimizing extremist conspiracy theorists like Teddy by proving his theories correct?</p><p>Not really! <em>Bugonia </em>still highlights how dangerous Teddy is. He tortures Michelle, coerces Donny into chemical castration, murders cop Casey (Stavros Halkias), and is so out of touch with reality that he believes the antifreeze he kills his mother with is actually a miracle cure. In no way does <em>Bugonia </em>validate these actions.</p><p>The film does acknowledge that Teddy's conspiracies stem from real problems, though &mdash; and no, I'm not just talking about the aliens. His theorizing is rooted in legitimate issues: wealth disparity, environmental collapse, the broken healthcare system. Michelle has ties to all these evils, from her involvement in Sandy's coma to Auxolith's connection to declining bee populations. Because of this, she becomes the perfect embodiment of all of Teddy's suffering. That she is actually an alien adds an extra layer of veracity to Teddy's true complaints about the state of the world, although he's twisted the truth of the Andromedans' involvement on Earth entirely.</p><p>Still, the biggest question <em>Bugonia </em>poses isn't "Is Michelle actually an alien?" It's whether humanity is worth saving in the first place, even with dangerous conspiracy theorists like Teddy or soulless corporate figureheads like Michelle harming the people around them. <em>Bugonia</em>'s final montage of dead humans collapsed in a variety of situations, from clubbing to prayer, highlights that there's so much more to humanity than the polar opposites we've been following for the whole film. No one person can truly encompass it all.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2w1r?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bugonia%20is%20now%20in%20select%20theaters%2C%20and%20opens%20wide%20on%20Oct.%2031.&object_type=article&object_uuid=00QDzRWE3rvBAZo7cRwMuuq&short_url=9l2w1r&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Bugonia </em>is now in select theaters, and opens wide on Oct. 31.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Tech is not one-size fits all. If you're someone who wants to actually stay in tune with the world around you and/or finds in-ear designs uncomfortable, open earbuds might be a good pick for you. And it's a good time to try them out, as two of Anker Soundcore's open earbuds are on sale for their <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0DCZ2QFV8" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best prices ever.</a></p><p>As of Oct. 24, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbM8pJ?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Anker%20Soundcore%20Aerofit%202%20open%20earbuds&object_type=article&object_uuid=00VgG63TW7jun3O6vi08nzZ&short_url=QbM8pJ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Anker Soundcore Aerofit 2 open earbuds</a> are on sale for just $77.99 at Amazon. That's 40% off their $129.99 list price. If you'd rather go for an even more budget-friendly pick, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31Ol2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Anker%20Soundcore%20C30i%20open%20earbuds&object_type=article&object_uuid=00VgG63TW7jun3O6vi08nzZ&short_url=z31Ol2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Anker Soundcore C30i open earbuds</a> are also on sale for just $34.99 at Amazon &mdash;&nbsp;a 50% discount from their $69.99 list price. Both pairs have hit their <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CTJR2C5X" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">lowest prices on record</a>. </p><p>Besides the price, these two earbud options vary vastly in design. The Aerofit 2 open earbuds feature an ear hook design with four adjustable angles. Mashable's reviewer Bethany Allard called them "the most comfortable (and snug) open-ear hook buds we've tried so far." The C30i earbuds, on the other hand, feature a clip design more like <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-ultra-open-earbuds" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Bose's Ultra Open earbuds</a>. They attach to the outer edge of your ears like a cuff and stay in place with the help of attachable ear grips.</p><p>We've actually tried out the Aerofit 2s and they earned a spot on our list of the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-open-earbuds" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best open earbuds</a>. Allard writes, "If you want open earbuds that are excellent for workouts, still great for daily use, and don't cost a ton, you want the Anker Soundcore AeroFit 2 earbuds." At 40% off their list price, they're an incredible value. If you're unsure whether open earbuds are right for you, the C30i might be the better choice, as they'll only set you back $34.99. With either option, you can rest assured you're getting the best possible price.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This electric toothbrush makes it a mission to help you more efficiently clean your teeth.

So if one is too rough, you can switch to another. </p><p>It comes with two extra brush heads as well. The brush itself will remind you when it's time to replace the one you're using, so you don't have to make a guess at when you should change it out. And with a timer to help you know when you're brushing long enough, you can make sure you're spending the correct amount of time cleaning and trying to prevent cavities.</p><p>If it's time to replace your toothbrush, grab this one and overhaul your cleaning routine. You'll be glad you did, especially at a discount like this. </p>]]></content:encoded>

"><p>There's a reason the queer community loves horror. Sure, the spooks and campy thrills are fun, but as a genre, horror has long been a ripe territory for metaphor, and for exploring the dark and fantastical sides of otherness that's so inherent to many queer and trans experiences.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-does-queer-mean" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Queerness</a> has been all over the history of horror, even if it hasn't always been loudly represented. From the queer coding of classic monster movies to very obviously gay vampire flicks, from horror sci-fi explorations of gender identity to the openly LGBTQ+ characters of modern slashers, queer and trans audiences have long found themselves reflected &mdash; whether intentionally or not &mdash; in the horror genre.</p><p>This spooky season, whether you're in the mood for a queer cannibal romance, a surreal lesbian vampire tale, a gay cruising thriller, a haunted house comedy, or a trans horror twist on <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, there are plenty of movies to keep you entertained and up at night throughout October.</p><h2><em>Jennifer's Body</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>"I go both ways." Name a better, queerer, and funnier line of dialogue from a horror movie monster. Megan Fox's iconic "My tit!" reaction is a close second. Both of those lines from <em>Jennifer's Body</em> highlight the brilliance of Diablo Cody's script, and the perfect balance of tone that director Karyn Kusama strikes throughout the cult horror comedy, a film unfairly lambasted upon release that's found its long-deserved appreciation in recent years.</p><p>Back in 2009, <em>Jennifer's Body</em> was slammed by male critics and audiences with a 46 percent <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/rotten-tomatoes-movie-rating.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Rotten Tomatoes</a> score and a C- Cinemascore.

This is a film about the absolute hell that is growing up as a teenage girl, about male violence towards and the sexualization of femininity, about trauma, and about the monstrous pain of queer repression. <em>Jennifer's Body</em> cleverly uses the tools of its genre &mdash; over-the-top gore, suspense, and camp &mdash; to subvert expectations and tell a story that, at its tit-covered heart, is funny as hell, and pretty damn gay.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><em>Jennifer's Body</em> is streaming on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWEEJl?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hulu&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=QWEEJl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Hulu</a> and available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao66nL?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=ao66nL&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Prime Video</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/OM74D?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=OM74D&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple TV.</a></p><h2><em>Cat People</em> (1942)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>Lesbians, cats, and witchcraft collide oh-so-perfectly in the fantastic B-horror movie <em>Cat People</em> (not to be confused with Paul Schrader's synth-heavy 1982 remake, which shifted its focus to even more risqu&eacute; taboos, such as, uh, incest). This eerie, atmospheric film from Jacques Tourneur follows a Serbian woman named Irena (Simone Simon) who becomes fixated on the idea that she may be a descendant of an ancient society of people who morphed into cats. "Crazy!" thinks her new husband, who's also aware of the fact that Irena has yet to kiss him, and who's also spending more and more time with his pretty female coworker. Irena grows jealous of this other woman and begins to stalk her.

<p>Set at a gay cruising beach in the glistening summertime of rural France, 2013's <em>Stranger by the Lake</em> remains one of the most fascinating, haunting, and sexiest erotic thrillers of years. Franck (Pierre Deladonchamps) arrives at the popular cruising spot and soon sets his eye on a mysterious stud named Michel (Christophe Paou). The attraction is mutual, as some incredibly hot beachside sex scenes show, but <em>Stranger by the Lake</em> makes a severe pivot when one character witnesses a horrific act. In Alain Guiraudie's film, the horror comes less from what's seen on screen and more from the film's psychological examination of lust and voyeurism &mdash; particularly when intimacy and desire become tangled up with acts of violence and aggression.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><em>Stranger by the Lake </em>is streaming for free on <a href="https://zdcs.link/WmAZ7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kanopy&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=WmAZ7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Kanopy</u></a> and available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/r0xjG?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=r0xjG&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Prime Video</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Z4Wpg?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=VUDU&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=Z4Wpg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>VUDU</u></a>.</p><h2><em>Under the Skin</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Jonathan Glazer's sci-fi masterpiece <em>Under the Skin</em> is the type of movie that leaves you uncomfortable, transfixed, and possibly unable to move from your seat once the credits roll. Scarlett Johansson, giving what is easily her best and most subtle performance, plays a nameless woman who drives around Scotland at night searching for random men to pick up in her van. The rest is best left unspoiled, but what earns it a spot on this list is how <em>Under the Skin</em> serves as a fascinating exploration of what it feels like to be a trans person in a society dominated by, and oriented around, cisnormative ideas of gender and bodies. It's a haunting tale about otherness, about the paralyzing loneliness and horror of realizing that you &mdash; and your body &mdash; are not like those around you, that it's alien, even unnatural to some. <em>Under the Skin, </em>almost surely unintentionally on Glazer's part, taps into a specific trans perspective of the interior longing to connect with, to understand, and to feel aligned with the exterior. It's beautiful and tragic and horrifying, and some of the most imaginative sci-fi horror filmmaking the genre's ever seen.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><em>Under the Skin</em><strong> </strong>is available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLMM20?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=QLMM20&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Prime Video</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/dLgB6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=dLgB6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple TV</a>.</p><h2><em>Bones and All</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In director Luca Guadagnino's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bones-and-all-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Bones and All</u></em></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cannibalism-movies-tv-meaning" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>cannibalism</u></a> serves as a potent metaphor for an unquenchable desire and longing for that which is taboo or even evil by some standards. It's clear to see the queer symbolism across the horror romance starring Taylor Russell and Timoth&eacute;e Chalamet, who play a pair of outcast lovers on the run, &agrave; la Terrence Malick's <em>Badlands </em>&mdash; and there are some explicit queer moments throughout. The two wanderers both suffer from an inescapable hunger to feed on people, a new twist on the age-old horror trope of vampirism as a metaphor for queer desire. Remove the grotesque element of eating people, and you get a story about two teens burdened with shame and alienation simply for the way they yearn for love and connection. But <em>Bones and All</em> also understands how that non-heteronormative longing is viewed as grotesque and monstrous by so much of society.

<p>Vampire films have long been fixtures of sapphic storytelling, from 1936's <em>Dracula's Daughter</em> to the explosion of lesbian vamp films in the '70s, but <em>Daughters of Darkness</em> is easily the GOAT. This 1971 Belgian film takes the folklore of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elizabeth-Bathory" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Elizabeth B&aacute;thory</u></a> &mdash; a 16th-century Hungarian countess rumored to have drunk the blood of the women she lusted after &mdash; and turns it into an erotic psychological horror story.&nbsp;</p><p>French actress Delphine Seyrig plays the Countess, a platinum blonde, red-lipsticked menace who saunters around a vacant seaside hotel in sparkling gowns alongside her quiet secretary/girlfriend. But when a young woman arrives on honeymoon with her husband, the Countess's unquenchable desire sets in, and she'll do anything to have her. <em>Daughters of Darkness</em> is a surreal trip of a movie that's like the stylish and subversive art-house cinema of Rainer Werner Fassbinder cross-pollinated with '70s lesbian erotica.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><em>Daughters of Darkness </em>is streaming on <a href="https://zdcs.link/EvYmn?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Shudder&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=EvYmn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Shudder</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/8yZK1?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AMC%2B%20or%20Shudder%20via%20Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=8yZK1&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>AMC+ or Shudder via Prime Video</u></a>, and with ads on <a href="https://zdcs.link/JYKnG?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=VUDU&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=JYKnG&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>VUDU</u></a>, and is available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/eLkn5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=eLkn5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple TV.</u></a></p><h2><em>Bodies Bodies Bodies</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>The Lure</em> has been described as a lesbian mermaid horror musical, but somehow even that doesn't come close to capturing what this audacious Polish film is. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/silent-twins-interview-agnieszka-smoczynska" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Agnieszka Smoczy&#324;ska</u></a>'s debut feature is the darkest retelling of <em>The Little Mermaid</em> you could imagine, incorporating grisly violence and the sex work industry into that classic fairytale.&nbsp;</p><p>After two young singing mermaids, Silver (Marta Mazurek) and Gold (Michalina Olsza&#324;ska), are invited onshore, the girls become the newest members of a cabaret-like band where they strip and dance on stage. The girls have legs when out of water but no genitals (much to the male characters' frustration), which becomes a focal point for Silver, who becomes increasingly desperate for an operation to change that. The only catch is, losing her fin also means losing her voice.&nbsp;</p><p>This is where <em>The Lure</em> becomes a trans take on the classic mermaid story. It's a metaphor for medical transition, a grim love story with incisive commentary on transmisogyny, and through the characters of Silver and Gold, the film explores two different trans feminine perspectives on transition, as well as their own queer sexuality.<em> The Lure</em> is a gory, thrilling, and bold spectacle that's unlike anything you've ever seen.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><em>The Lure</em> is streaming on <a href="https://zdcs.link/2Xnye?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Criterion%20Channel&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=2Xnye&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>The Criterion Channel</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/OM73D?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Max&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=OM73D&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Max</a>, and is available to rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/6grK2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=6grK2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Prime Video</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/RVOG7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=RVOG7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple TV</u></a>.</p><h2>The Fear Street Trilogy</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Leigh Janiak's Fear Street trilogy is the queer horror thrill ride of every '90s kid's dreams. Spanning three time periods with two separate casts and a queer couple as the protagonists, the <em>Fear Street</em> movies bring R.L. Stine's book series to the screen with plenty of blood, spooky lore, teen romance drama, and some killer '90s needle drops on the soundtrack. The story centers on a group of friends who try to undo a decades-old curse on their town that's led to it being dubbed the murder capital of the country. Most fun and innovative is how each film in Janiak's trilogy pays homage to a different horror subgenre, from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/fear-street-1994-netflix-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Fear Street Part 1: 1994</u></em></a> evoking the slasher vibes of <em>Scream</em> and <em>I Know What You Did Last Summer</em>, the <em>Friday the 13th</em> terror of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/netflix-fear-street-part-2-1978-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Fear Street Part 2: 1978</u></em></a>, and the pagan folk horror of the witchy finale, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/netflix-fear-street-part-3-1666-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Fear Street Part 3</u></em><u>: <em>1666</em></u><u>.</u></a></p><p>But these movies aren't just on this list for simply having queer leads.

<p>Many pre-code classic horror films are gurgling with queerness, and much of that is thanks to the work of openly gay filmmaker James Whale. Everything from <em>Frankenstein </em>to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/not-scary-horror-movies" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Old Dark House</u></em></a> and <em>The Invisible Man</em> has been dissected by <a href="https://mashable.com/article/queer-for-fear-shudder" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>queer film historians</u></a>, but it's Whale's <em>The Bride of Frankenstein</em> that remains the queerest of them all. This is a movie about the ways gay male relationships are constantly thwarted by society and deemed, well, monstrous.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, the sequel is about the creation of a female mate for Boris Karloff's Monster, but that preoccupation with heterosexuality is kinda the point &mdash; she's the beard. Of course, no one in this movie is overtly gay, but you can read the Monster finding safety with a blind man as him finding a gay companion, or even the Bride's creation scene as two men's attempt to use their power to create life despite their inability to procreate together. From the layers of queer coding and campy humor all over Whale's sequel, it's no doubt Elsa Lanchester's Bride has become cemented as a fixture of drag culture.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><em>The Bride of Frankenstein</em> is streaming on <a href="https://zdcs.link/oPKvY?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=oPKvY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Prime Video</u></a>, and is available to rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/WmAR7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=WmAR7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple TV</u></a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/m0Pl6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=VUDU&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=m0Pl6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>VUDU</u></a>.</p><h2><em>The Blackening</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Few things are hotter than the image of Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie as cool-as-hell ancient vampires sauntering around an underground nightclub as they cruise for their next meal. But Tony Scott's cult favorite <em>The Hunger</em> is memorable for more than its good-looking and fashionable leads; it's also one of the sharpest examples of the vampire story as a metaphor for queerness.&nbsp;</p><p>In the world of these vampires, love, desire, and companionship goes beyond gender, and while Deneuve and Bowie's Miriam and John Blaylock have been lovers for centuries, Miriam begins to set her sights on a new companion once John becomes ill: Susan Sarandon's doctor Sarah. Beyond the lesbian love story, Scott's 1983 film can also be read as a commentary on the AIDS crisis through John's sudden onset of an incurable illness that his doctors mindlessly dismiss. There's also a pervading sense of grief and loneliness across the film that feels true to the experiences of many LGBTQ+ folks who survived the AIDS epidemic &mdash; a haunting sadness that Miriam, the most ancient of vampires, is condemned to throughout her immortality, as she's forced to forever grieve the lovers she outlasts.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><em>The Hunger</em> is available to rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/VmRbg?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=VmRbg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Prime Video</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/qmjby?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=qmjby&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple TV</u></a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/EvYXn?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=VUDU&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=EvYXn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>VUDU</u></a>.</p><h2><em>The Hitcher</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In <em>The Hitcher</em>, a young guy driving across the country to his dream destination of California stops in the middle of a rainy night in who-knows-where to pick up a hitchhiker. Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) can hardly keep his eyes open, so hopefully this stranger will help him stay awake. The stranger who calls himself John Ryder, played by a terrifying and near emotionless Rutger Hauer, is the exact type of hitchhiker your mother warned you about picking up &mdash; a maniacal killer.&nbsp;</p><p>On the surface, <em>The Hitcher</em> could be read as a classic road horror movie about a deranged psychopath who taunts and terrorizes with no motive. But queer coding is all over this '80s film &mdash; so much so that Hauer doesn't exactly make John's advances on Jim subtle &mdash; and the film could easily be viewed as a horror thriller about a gay man hell-bent on unleashing his rage on heteronormative society, and perhaps seeking a partner to go on that killing spree with him.

<p>In <em>Thelma</em>, Norwegian filmmaker Joachim Trier takes the queer subtext of Brian De Palma's <em>Carrie</em> and brings it right to the surface. In this 2017 psychological horror thriller, the titular Thelma (Eili Harboe) is a shy and repressed young woman who leaves her sheltered, conservative Christian home for the first time to go off to college. There, she discovers queer desire when she meets and becomes infatuated with Anja (Kaya Wilkins), along with a sudden onset of violent seizures that cause a series of strange happenings. Thelma's powers, like Carrie's, emerge as an outward manifestation of a suppressed woman's desire for agency and control. What makes Trier's film so visceral is how he uses the trappings of horror and supernatural storytelling to tell a very queer coming-of-age tale as Thelma grapples with expressing her rage and identity all at once.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><em>Thelma</em> is streaming for free on <a href="https://zdcs.link/xJ5Jm?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kanopy&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=xJ5Jm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Kanopy</u></a>, and is available to rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/76m6L?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=76m6L&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Prime Video</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/2XnXe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=2XnXe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple TV</u></a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/OM7MD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=VUDU&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=OM7MD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>VUDU</u></a>.</p><h2><em>Wendell &amp; Wild</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Subtextual queerness in movies doesn't only mean unspoken nods to sexuality, but it also reflects the inherent otherness of growing up as a queer person &mdash; this is especially true for the horror genre. In the case of <em>The Craft</em>, queerness comes through in the form of four teenage girls whose goth aesthetic, rejection of the status quo, and witchy doings can be seen as a stand-in for the abnormality and derogatory difference that's long been associated with being queer. In <em>The Craft</em>, it's the weirdos, the freaks, the outcasts who turn to the supernatural to wield some sense of control over the strait-laced hetero world that rejects them so readily. What's gayer than a bunch of girls exploring their power over their own bodies with a little "Light As a Feather, Stiff As a Board" sleepover seance anyway?</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><em>The Craft</em> is streaming on <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrrKe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Paramount%2B&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=zJrrKe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Paramount+</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/pL3L4?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=pL3L4&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Prime Video</u></a><u>,</u> and on <a href="https://zdcs.link/98PPZd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Tubi&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=98PPZd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tubi</a> with ads, and is available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/KY3Y8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=KY3Y8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple TV</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/3Z0ZK?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=VUDU&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=3Z0ZK&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>VUDU</u></a>.</p><h2><em>Seconds</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In John Frankenheimer's masterful sci-fi film <em>Seconds</em>, a middle-aged man who lives an unfulfilled life as a banker discovers a company that gives people alternate identities via plastic surgery. Arthur Hamilton (played by John Randolph) decides to undergo the procedure that turns him into the man of everyone's dreams circa 1966: Rock Hudson. Arthur is now Tony Wilson (played by Hudson), a hot young artist with a beachside villa. But the transition into a new life, and keeping the secret of his old one, begins to torture Tony.</p><p><em>Seconds</em> is a fascinating psychological horror sci-fi hybrid that speaks to trans and queer identity on multiple levels.

<p>All gays know <em>Scream</em> is queer. It's canon (no, <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2021/12/06/scream-kevin-williamson-gay/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>literally</u></a>). The iconic slasher franchise has queerness all over it &mdash; and the writers finally gave us an overt queer character in the latest installments, with <a href="https://mashable.com/video/scream-vi-jasmin-savoy-brown" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Jasmin Savoy Brown</u></a>'s Mindy. But it's the reveal of the killers behind the Ghostface mask at the end of the first <em>Scream</em> that really solidified things. Skeet Ulrich's Billy and Matthew Lillard's Stu were so obviously gay, so much so that even the first <em>Scary Movie </em>said it right out loud. Even <em>Scream</em> writer Kevin Williamson has revealed in recent years that the two characters were based on famed gay killers <a href="https://pridesource.com/article/billyandstu" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Leopold and Loeb</u></a>.

<p>Ah yes, the film that gave us Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt as a gay vampire couple. While the curse of being a blood-sucking creature of the night has long been associated with queer identity, it has more often favored lesbian storytelling; however, <em>Interview with the Vampire</em> finally gave us two queer men bonded in their blood lust. Of course, the 1994 Neil Jordan film never made that gay relationship explicit, but there's no doubt that when Cruise's ancient vampire Lestat turns the young Louis (Pitt) into one of his kind, the two begin a life reminiscent of any closeted gay couple. They even turn and raise a young girl (Kirsten Dunst) as a child of their own. After venturing abroad, the little vampire family is threatened by the allure of another very hot, very gay vampire in Antonio Banderas's Armand.

<p><em>We're All Going to the World's Fair </em>is a horror film for and about anyone who grew up with the internet. This micro-budget indie from filmmaker Jane Schoenbrun is essentially <em>Creepypasta the Movie</em>. Casey (Anna Cobb) is a lonely teen who joins an online role playing game and begins to grow paranoid that something strange is happening to her mind and body. Schoenbrun's film isn't scary in the traditional sense, except for some freaky creepypasta-esque imagery, but more so a film that aims to show the psychology of extreme loneliness, depression, and alienation &mdash; all intense, scary things that many queer folks who grew up online experienced.</p><p>While the film isn't explicitly queer, it's been <a href="https://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/2022/4/22/were-all-going-worlds-fair-hypnotic-trans-horror-film" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>hailed as a trans horror film</u></a> by <a href="https://www.them.us/story/were-all-going-to-the-worlds-fair-jane-schoenbrun-q-and-a" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>several critics</u></a>, and it's not hard to see why. Schoenbrun, who is nonbinary, has made a film that evokes the constant unease, terror, and anxiety of gender dysphoria before you may even know what that is, and the urge to escape into another reality (i.e., the internet) to find yourself. In one scene, Casey buoyantly dances in her room to a pop song before suddenly stopping, as if to realize she's been possessed. She lets out a horrifying shriek, then goes right back to giddily dancing. It's haunting in an indescribable way, and speaks to a constant masking and toggling between identities that's all too familiar to the experience of dysphoria.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><em>We're All Going to the World's Fair</em> is streaming on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbMMBj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Shudder&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=QbMMBj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Shudder</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/NyGyG?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kanopy&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=NyGyG&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Kanopy</u></a>, and is available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/lbJbR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=lbJbR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Prime Video</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/dLgLj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=dLgLj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple TV</u></a>.</p><h2><em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>Rocky Horror</em> might not be a movie that'll give you nightmares &mdash; unless you're afraid of kinky, horny queers going bananas at a deranged house party, and if so, get outta here! Nevertheless, the wacky cult classic is a spooky season staple. A riff on B-movie sci-fi and monster movies of the past, the musical horror comedy takes us, along with Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick's square-as-can-be couple, on a wild trip to Transsexual Transylvania. There's Time-Warping and Tim Curry's Frankenstein-esque monster-making, there's ax-hunting and laser guns and seduction and dancing &mdash; so much dancing! <em>Rocky Horror</em> is a joyously bizarro classic that belongs to the weirdo queers and us alone.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em> is available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/BJVJN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=BJVJN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Prime Video</u></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/0OB8QM5VV3JSEDHVV6433LM9OM/ref=atv_dl_rdr?tag=justus1ktp-20" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>,</u></a> <a href="https://zdcs.link/MYxYk?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=MYxYk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple TV</u></a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/gLVL8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=VUDU&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=gLVL8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>VUDU</u></a>.</p><h2><em>The Haunting</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>The Haunting </em>is a classic horror film about a classic type of horror story: a haunted house. You won't find any cheap jump scares or acts of violence in this 1963 film, though. Instead, director Robert Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton use a mix of innovative visual techniques and camera tricks, from gliding tracking shots and anamorphic lenses, to create an atmosphere of total paranoia and unease that's genuinely unnerving to watch.</p><p>The film, based on the Shirley Jackson novel <em>The Haunting of Hill House</em>, follows a group of strangers who arrived at a haunted mansion to prove the existence of ghosts, including the timid Eleanor (Julie Harris) and the bold Theo (Claire Bloom) &mdash; yes, the same queer Theo from Netflix's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/haunting-hill-house-domestic-horror-love" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Hill House</u></em></a> series. Theo is the rare example of an explicitly lesbian character in classic horror, much less classic cinema overall, and most notably, her queerness is never treated with disdain or mockery. While her sexuality isn't overtly stated, it's a fascinating element of a story about women choosing to experience the evils of a haunted house to escape the real-world anxieties and trauma of their daily lives.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><em>The Haunting</em> is available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/kV8k3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=kV8k3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Prime Video</u></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.00a9f7c2-9ce9-272b-e579-654cb684090c?autoplay=0&amp;ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>,</u></a> <a href="https://zdcs.link/vb2RP?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=vb2RP&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple TV</u></a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/VmRYO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=VUDU&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=VmRYO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>VUDU</u></a>.</p><h2><em>Border</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>An underseen gem, 2018's <em>Border</em> is a Swedish body-horror romance about otherness that will speak to anyone who knows what it feels like to finally find someone like you. Tina (Eva Melander) is a customs officer with an ability to smell guilt, making her especially good at catching contraband at her job. Tina also believes she has some type of developmental disorder, describing herself as an "ugly, strange human with a chromosome flaw," which leads to an isolated and lonely life. But one day a man with similar bodily features to Tina's appears at her work, and it's a powerful moment of recognizing that maybe she isn't alone, and maybe she's finally found her person.</p><p><em>Border</em> is a wild, highly original tale full of unsettling twists that's also super trans. Amid its dark fantasy and suspense, this Cannes Film Festival winner is a transfixing and emotional story about spending a lifetime thinking something is wrong with you, the rage and pain that can fester from it, and to finally feel seen as you are for the first time.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><em>Border</em> is streaming on <a href="https://zdcs.link/qmjep?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=DIRECTV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=qmjep&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>DIRECTV</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKqq3V?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Tubi&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=QKqq3V&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tubi</a> with ads, and is available to rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/EvYqo?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=EvYqo&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Prime Video</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Y4o1l?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=Y4o1l&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple TV</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/8yZvO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=VUDU&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=8yZvO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>VUDU</u></a>.</p><h2><em>The Lost Boys</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In <em>The Lost Boys</em>, we get vampires in the form of a biker gang, and honestly, there's nothing gayer than that. When brothers Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim) move to a beachside town in Northern California with their mother (Dianne Wiest, who, by law, makes every film campier, gayer, and better), eldest brother Michael soon falls in with a local motorcycle crew who also happen to be blood-suckers. While it's a girl who first catches Michael's eye, there's no denying the big queer energy that soon evolves when he's initiated into the vampire group. Kiefer Sutherland as David Powers, the platinum blonde leather-clad leader of the gang, oozes homoerotic desire towards Michael, whose vampiric transformation can be read as a coming-out of sorts. Even Haim&rsquo;s Sam can be read as queer through small but unmissable character details, like a very suggestive Rob Lowe poster hanging on his bedroom wall. The Joel Schumacher film brings campy, queer goodness to a genre storytelling staple that was foundational for many young queers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><em>The Lost Boys</em> is available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/eLkll?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=eLkll&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Prime Video</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/X10oB?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=X10oB&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple TV</u></a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/bLBox?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=VUDU&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=bLBox&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>VUDU</u></a>.</p><h2><em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> is a big, gay, gothic horror story about two rich older queens obsessed with the radiant beauty of a young closeted dandy, and how that young dandy sells his soul to stay forever gorgeous and young. Sure, the Oscar Wilde novel that Albert Lewin's 1945 film is based on is about vanity and the superficial desires of a group of aristocratic white men, but it's also about living with the unbearable torture of queer repression and internalized homophobia.&nbsp;</p><p>When the 22-year-old Dorian Gray (Hurd Hatfield) gazes upon his luminous portrait and wishes to never age a day, something magical happens &mdash; Dorian's dashing looks remain fixed, and the portrait ages instead. It also begins to reflect the sins of Dorian's behavior. It's impossible to not read <em>Dorian Gray</em> through a queer lens, given Wilde's personal life, as well as the flamboyant performances and attitudes expressed by the film's three male characters. This is a story about doing absolutely everything in your power to suppress your true self to the outside world, and that no matter how hard you try, you'll be forced to look at the wretched toll it takes on your soul.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><em>The Picture of Dorian Gray </em>is streaming on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxxnO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=HBO%20Max&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=QxxxnO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">HBO Max</a>, and is available for rent or purchase on <a href="https://zdcs.link/xJ5RY?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=xJ5RY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Prime Video</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/GYJvB?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=GYJvB&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple TV</u></a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/76mL4?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=VUDU&object_type=article&object_uuid=03l1infimRA37yDsAK5DbZg&short_url=76mL4&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>VUDU</u></a>.</p><h2><em>The Shape of Water</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>No one blends fantasy and romance with horror and suspense quite like Guillermo del Toro. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-shape-of-water-movie-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>The 2018 Best Picture winner </u></a>is a movie where the most otherized characters &mdash; a woman <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2018/03/an-interview-with-the-shape-of-waters-sign-language-coach-amanda-richer.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>who uses ASL</u></a> to communicate (Sally Hawkins's Elisa), a closeted gay man (Richard Jenkins's Giles), a Black woman (Octavia Spencer's Zelda), and a giant fish-man (Doug Jones) &mdash; are targeted and labeled as the monsters threatening society. Del Toro takes the classic monster movie horror theatrics of <em>The Creature from the Black Lagoon</em> and reshapes it into a moving, heroic tale about those on the fringes of society fighting back and liberating themselves from the real monsters &mdash; in this case, Michael Shannon's terrifying colonel set on hunting down Jones's creature to exploit for the 1960s space race. </p><p>But <em>The Shape of Water</em> is also a love story that queers traditional hetero narratives through a swooning romance between Elisa and the fish-man. In del Toro&rsquo;s fantastical world, two lonely and ostracized characters finally get to experience love, acceptance, and pleasure together &mdash; and that pleasure is incredibly sexual, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/why-shape-water-fish-man-needed-a-nice-butt-1061982/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>as the filmmaker intended</u></a>.

<p>Many classic Hitchcock films are brimming with queer undercurrents, from the transfeminine villany of <em>Psycho</em> to the gay murderous couple of <em>Rope</em>, but <em>Rebecca</em> offers a different kind of queer story. In the 1940 psychological thriller, Joan Fontaine's second Mrs. de Winter and her new husband, Maxim (Laurence Olivier), arrive at the gothic mansion that is to be her new home, only to discover that that home is deeply haunted by echoes of the first Mrs. de Winter. It's Maxim's late wife, the never-seen Rebecca, who consumes our otherwise-unnamed protagonist with jealousy and self-doubt.&nbsp;</p><p>Where the queerness arrives most notably is in the form of the icy housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), who reveals her not-so-subtle obsession with the late Rebecca. In one <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/haysd-decoding-the-classics-rebecca-1940-214695/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>famously analyzed</u></a> scene, Mrs. Danvers gives a tour of Rebecca's old bedroom, caressing her dressing gown, displaying her underwear drawer as if it were treasure, and speaking of Rebecca as if she were a longtime secret lover.

<h2>Pro: Some of the new features are great</h2><p>Every new version of iOS comes with new feature drops, of course. Some years bring very little, while other years bring a lot. There are at least a couple of new features in iOS 26 that put this year's update in the latter category.</p><p>For starters, it's got Live Translation in Messages, FaceTime, and phone calls. Two people who speak different languages being able to mutually understand each other over the phone is probably the best application yet of Apple Intelligence. Sure, it might be a little awkward having to wait to listen to a translation of what was just said to you before responding, but not as awkward as not understanding what was said at all. </p><p>That's genuinely kind of transformative, but there are other standouts, as well. Being able to make polls and set custom backgrounds in group chats in Messages seem small, but they could inject a lot of personality into spaces where you commune with your loved ones and friends. That's not nothing, and you can only do it on iOS 26.</p><h2>Pro: You might like Liquid Glass</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Liquid Glass didn't just come to the iPhone. Thanks to macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, and other OS updates, it's also changing the look of MacBooks, iPads, and Apple Watches. Mashable's tech editor gave iPadOS 26 a positive review, thanks in part to the new Liquid Glass design. Many users like the translucent glass effect. </p><p>To quote our review:</p><blockquote><p>Per <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/ipados-26-introduces-powerful-new-features-that-push-ipad-even-further/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple</a>, Liquid Glass "combines the optical qualities of glass with a fluidity only Apple can achieve." What does that mean? Core elements of the user interface are now translucent and expressive, so when objects overlap or interact, new liquid-like animations cause a transparent light effect, as if you're looking through glass or water...I haven't experienced any lag with the subtle animations that occur when different widgets or icons meet at the edges. Liquid Glass also makes the simplest interactions a lot more satisfactory. In the updated camera app, switching between Photo, Video, Pano, and other settings causes the text to bend and refract.</p></blockquote><p>Liquid Glass also comes with new custom lock screens, which allow you to add a touch of personalization to your iPhone.</p><h2>Con: You might not like Liquid Glass</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Again, the most noteworthy change Apple made with iOS 26 is Liquid Glass, and the new design language permeates the entire UI on your iPhone after you install the update. It makes everything look, well, like liquid glass, with lots of transparency effects and dynamic animations that make everything flow very nicely &mdash;&nbsp;when it works. </p><p>There's just one problem: Not everyone likes Liquid Glass. While you have <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ios-26-how-to-turn-off-liquid-glass" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">some control over how it looks</a>, the added effects and transparency don't work for everyone. You also can't <em>really</em> turn it off. One of the latest iOS 26 beta builds has <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-offers-tinted-liquid-glass-alternative-for-beta-users" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">a new "tinted glass" mode</a> that lets you exert a little more control over how Liquid Glass looks, but it still falls short of just allowing users to retain the old UI, and it's just a beta feature. I don't personally mind Liquid Glass (although I did tweak it a bit to make a little less glassy), but if you absolutely hate it, you might want to hold back on installing iOS 26.</p><h2>Pro: Crucial app redesigns</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Aside from new features and a new design language, iOS 26 also introduced at least one <em>vitally </em>important app redesign. Of course, I'm talking about the Photos app. </p><p>On previous versions of iOS, Photos had become a jumbled mess with multiple confusingly laid out tabs. It was harder than it should be to just find your library or your Favorites folder, for example, at least until you got used to it. On iOS 26, Photos has been streamlined so there are just two tabs, Library and Collections, at the bottom of the screen. One of them shows you everything on your phone, while the other shows you everything you've put into folders. </p><p>It's so simple that it makes you wonder why it wasn't always this way. </p><h2>Con: Your battery might suffer</h2><p>Last but certainly not least, there have been <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ios-26-battery-drain-what-users-are-saying" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">numerous user complaints</a> that iOS 26 is affecting &mdash;&nbsp;or even outright ruining &mdash; the battery life on their iPhones. To be perfectly clear, this has not affected everyone or even a majority of iOS 26 users, but that doesn't mean it isn't real.</p><p>There are some potential explanations for this. Apple itself says that this is a temporary setback as your phone gets used to the new update (my words, not theirs). Some have claimed that updating all your apps and power cycling the device helps. Low Power Mode (and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-battery-drain-ios-26-fix" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the new Adaptive Power setting</a>) could alleviate this, at least, potentially. It's also possible that none of those will work, at which point you might need to make an appointment with Apple support. </p><p>I personally don't have anything against iOS 26, having used it since it launched, but there are good reasons not to upgrade.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/064yZiWTixlbfFIbQ3IB146/hero-image.png" alt="screenshots of three tiktoks about Group 7"><p>If you've been on <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tiktok" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">TikTok</a> lately, you've likely seen the Group 7 <a href="https://mashable.com/category/memes" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">meme</a>, and you'd be forgiven if you don't quite understand what's going on with it. The whole thing connects back to a single source and, strangely enough, it's actually a remarkably well-conceived bit of promotional posting. </p><p>And don't worry, it's not too difficult to understand. </p><p>We <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-group-7-tiktok-trend-explained-sophia-james" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">covered Group 7 as it first broke onto the online scene</a>, but it has since grown even more popular. As Mashable's <a href="https://mashable.com/author/chance-townsend" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Chance Townsend</a> wrote earlier this week, the trend stems from <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sophiajamesmusic" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">singer Sophia James</a> promoting her song "So Unfair" on TikTok. James posted seven separate videos promoting the single that put people in "groups" based on which video showed up on your algorithm, and, for whatever reason, the final TikTok labeling "Group 7" went viral. It's now racked up some 63 million views. </p><blockquote class="tiktokEmbed tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7562061800192183583" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<p>So why did it go viral? Simply put, it became an inside joke &mdash; the thing to be because TikTok collectively decided it was. Everyone suddenly wanted to be in Group 7. The lore unfolded in the comments: Group 7 was elite. Top replies on James' original <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sophiajamesmusic/video/7562061800192183583" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">post</a> read, "I didn&rsquo;t choose Group 7, Group 7 chose me!" and "Group 7 is a group full of baddies that always win, just saying."

That's all it was," James told Mashable over email earlier this week. "But the reason I make and perform music in the first place is to foster community and connect with people, so the way this thing is bringing people together is literally a dream come true."</p><p>And the trend <em>has </em>brought an (albeit strange) sense of community to TikTokkers. People really want to be a part of Group 7.</p><p>User <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@popsamcam/video/7564055795139087647" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">@popsamcam</a> explained how that fact is a bit of marketing genius. </p><blockquote class="tiktokEmbed tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7564055795139087647" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<p>Soon enough, it spread to the real world &mdash; workers asking their colleagues if they're Group 7, for example. It's an inside joke for millions of people on the app.</p><blockquote class="tiktokEmbed tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7563728621978881293" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<p>With time, everything became attached to the Group 7 meme. This TikTok about bringing back the word "grody" from @<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wesleyryann/video/7564289638563597598" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wesleyryann</a>&nbsp;racked up nearly 200,000 views and, yes, mentioned Group 7 at the end. </p><blockquote class="tiktokEmbed tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7564289638563597598" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<p>It's wild, but exceptionally like TikTok, to take such a benign thing and blow it up.

<p>The kit you're buying includes two Bosch Core 18V batteries and a fast charger (it takes about 65 minutes to get to a full charge). These batteries are designed to be lightweight and use Bosch's "CoolPack 2.0" tech to prevent overheating, which <em>should</em> help them last longer.</p><p>Once you add the battery kit to your cart, you can choose your freebie: a 1/2-inch hammer drill, an oscillating multi-tool, a reciprocating saw, or a 4.5-inch angle grinder. These are all cordless tools that run on the 18V batteries you just bought. Depending on which tool you choose, you're getting a free item worth up to $159. Plus, the tools come with a five-year warranty. </p><p>Lowe's says this deal runs through Jan. 7, 2026, so you could definitely snag this as a <a href="https://mashable.com/gifts" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">holiday gift</a> for the handy person in your life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It brings people together in shared chats, helps you learn with voice and visuals, and shows up with warmth, personality and even an appearance: Mico."</p></blockquote><p>That's all well and good, but come on, we're all going to compare Mico to Clippy, the (beloved?) paperclip that helped us navigate Microsoft programs back in the day.

The updates to Copilot, including Mico, went live in the U.S. and should roll out elsewhere soon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

There are <em>tons</em> of brands, and figuring out which features actually work (and which are just hype) is tough, especially on a budget. So, when Mashable Senior Shopping Reporter Leah Stodart tested the relatively unknown <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjXoe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=3i%20G10%2B&object_type=article&object_uuid=029ow2JqYpsNaUDMI9JzQWU&short_url=9gjXoe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">3i G10+</a> and called it the "most impressive robot vacuum under $500," we paid attention. And right now, it's on sale for <em>even less</em>.</p><p>As of Oct. 24, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjXoe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=3i%20G10%2B%20Robot%20Vacuum%20and%20Mop%20Combo&object_type=article&object_uuid=029ow2JqYpsNaUDMI9JzQWU&short_url=9gjXoe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">3i G10+ Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo</a> is on sale for $269.99, down from $449.99, at Amazon.

<p>What makes this one stand out, especially for the price, is how it handles dirt disposal. Instead of needing one of those giant <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-self-emptying-robot-vacuums" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">self-empty towers</a>, the G10+ actually compacts the debris inside its own dustbin. This means you might only need to empty it every couple of months, plus the charging dock is small enough to hide under furniture. Stodart also found its mapping really smart &mdash; it uses LiDAR and could even tell which rooms were bedrooms or bathrooms based on furniture. </p><p>It's got strong suction (18,000 Pa), uses AI to spot dirtier areas and adjust cleaning, handles carpets well, and avoids most obstacles. "The only time I really saw debris left behind was when I intentionally spilled a giant pile of rice on the kitchen floor, and the G10+ cleared about 90 percent of it in two passes," Stodart writes in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/3i-g10-plus-robot-vacuum-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">her review</a>. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The mopping function isn't super fancy, but it does have a little spinning edge mop that Stodart says detailed the wall where her bathroom floor and shower meet "quite well." </p><p>It also has a livestream camera, which is rare for vacuums at this price point. "I've never seen one of these on a robot vacuum that costs less than $1,000, let alone $500," she writes. "It sounds ridiculously unnecessary at first, but I know pet parents understand the appeal of being able to remotely check on their pets."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Though Apple has released a brand new pair of buds with the AirPods Pro 3, their previous iteration are every bit as worthy of picking up. They've been labeled as our <a href="https://%20https://mashable.com/roundup/best-earbuds" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">favorite earbuds for Apple users</a> multiple times in a row, taking the top spot in our <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-headphones" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best headphones</a> lists many times as well. </p><p>They get those top honors for their noise cancellation ability, great sound, and excellent battery life. They continue to prove themselves a great pick in terms of earbuds as well, even with the newer AirPods Pro 3 out in the wild. Their svelte profile, the way they fit into your ears comfortably, and even their usage as a status symbol for some make them an excellent candidate for your next pair of buds. </p><p>If you want to score these AirPods Pro 2 for their most recent Prime Day price, though, you'll want to act fast. They likely won't last long while they're discounted again.</p>]]></content:encoded>

But we love it even more when it's on sale. As of Oct. 24, the 13-inch option with 16GB RAM and 512GB of storage is down to just $999 at Amazon. That's $200 off its retail price and its best price on record. You'll essentially get double the storage for the same cost as the base model. If you don't need the more advanced specs of the MacBook Pro for things like video editing and graphic design work, the M4 Air will treat you more than fine.</p><h3>More MacBook deals</h3><p><strong><em>MacBook Air</em></strong></p><p><strong>M3</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/akwBg6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20MacBook%20Air%2C%2015-inch%20%28M3%2C%2016GB%20RAM%2C%20512GB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01FWU7MfxLQyQxtDjoWrcmV&short_url=akwBg6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple MacBook Air, 15-inch (M3, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)</a> &mdash;

Mashable's tech editor says, "It's the kind of gadget that makes you feel like you're living in the future." It's essentially everything we loved about the M4, but with a super-powered M5 chip &mdash; a razor-thin and feather-light design, a gorgeous display, and an unbeatable performance. That said, it's not for everyone. As our reviewer Tim Beck Werth notes, "Everyday use is wasted on this tablet." The larger 13-inch model starts at $1,299, but just days after its debut, it's already on sale for $50 off.</p><h3>More iPad deals</h3><p><strong>iPad</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp4bj0?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%2C%2011-inch%20%28A16%2C%20WiFi%2C%20128GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01FWU7MfxLQyQxtDjoWrcmV&short_url=Qp4bj0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple iPad, 11-inch (A16, WiFi, 128GB)</a> &mdash;

At $169.99, the Pro 2s aren't the cheapest they've ever been, but they're still a steal for what you get: excellent ANC, impressive sound quality, and seamless Apple device connectivity. You can likely get them even cheaper if you wait around until Black Friday.

      <description><![CDATA[Apple's new iOS brings a ton of changes and upgrades, but some users are experiencing a serious downgrade in battery life.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00a8Ww2rYmspSCPS2mVlYTN/hero-image.jpg" alt="iPhone installing new iOS update on top of a Macbook keyboard"><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/apple" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple</a> may have created a problem with the latest version of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/ios" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iOS</a>.</p><p>Since iOS 26 launched in September, there have been reports around the internet of the new update significantly <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-battery-drain-ios-26-fix" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">shortening battery life</a>, even on newer iPhones. For instance, one user on <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/256153355?sortBy=rank" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple's support message board</a> posted a thread at the beginning of this month claiming that their brand new iPhone 15 was impacted, and as they put it, the only possible explanation is iOS 26.</p><p>"Today, I was busy all day and did not use my phone from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., yet it still dropped from 90% to 45% without doing anything. No apps were open, the &ldquo;Refresh apps in background&rdquo; option was not enabled, the screen was set to turn off automatically after 30 seconds, and automatic brightness was enabled," the user wrote. "So it's definitely not the phone's fault because it's brand new with a 100% original battery, nor is it the settings because it was in permanent mode. So the fault lies solely with iOS. There are no excuses."</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            <span class="ml-1">iOS 26 is both the cause and solution to your iPhone battery problems</span>

        </a>
    </div>
<p>There are also lengthy Reddit threads about it. For example, in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone13ProMax/comments/1nlbebw/battery_drains_considerably_faster_on_ios_26/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">one thread</a>, users with iPhones as old as the iPhone 13 and as new as the iPhone 16 pointed out they were getting several hours less of battery life compared to what they had before the update. User Responsible_Film_778, who has an iPhone 13 Pro Max, summed it up succinctly.</p><p>"I have replaced the battery last year with Apple and it was exceptional with iOS 18.6. I was ending the day with 87% battery left with light usage. Now I&rsquo;m lucky if it&rsquo;s above 50%," the user wrote. "It seems to consume the battery when scrolling through the Liquid Glass enhanced tabs or panels. Really disappointed with this update. I have 98% battery health but it acts like it has lost 1/3 of its capacity. Hopefully a new update will come soon to rectify the problem."</p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/digitalix/status/1970979969548550598" title="(Opens in a new tab)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

    </a>
</blockquote>

<p>Naturally, you don't have to go far on X to find people mad about this, either. User @Digitalix complained that their iPhone 16 Pro is now only a "half-day phone" thanks to the iOS 26 update.</p><p>Of course, this hasn't all happened without any kind of response from Apple. The company has a support page with information about possible battery life downgrades as a result of software updates. According to Apple, it might just be temporary and could go away on its own as the company makes further updates to iOS 26.</p><blockquote><p>"Immediately after completing an update, particularly a major release, you might notice a temporary impact on battery life and thermal performance. This is normal, as your device needs time to complete the setup process in the background, including indexing data and files for search, downloading new assets, and updating apps.</p><p>New features are exciting and help you get even more out of your Apple product, though some may require additional resources from the device. Depending on individual usage, some users may notice a small impact on performance and/or battery life. Apple continually works to optimize these features in software updates to ensure great battery life and a smooth user experience."</p></blockquote><p>Users in the Apple support forum and Reddit threads also suggested some possible fixes, and Mashable previously wrote about the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ios-26-adaptive-power-mode-battery-upgrade-compatible-iphones" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">new "Adaptive Power" setting in iOS 26</a>. It sounds like updating all of your apps and then power cycling the phone helped some people, as third-party apps may not be optimized to run efficiently on iOS 26 right away. There are also other measures you can take, such as turning off ProMotion on higher-end iPhones or activating <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/101604" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Low Power Mode</a>. </p><p>Fingers crossed anyone dealing with this is able to fix it without sending their phone off to Apple for a battery replacement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd started Bumble in 2014 after founding <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tinder" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Tinder</u></a> years prior. Bumble was, for many years, women's answer to Tinder. That's because it utilizes the same "swipe left or right" model to either pass or seek to match with someone else, but there is a key difference between the two: on Bumble, only women can message first ("make the first move") in heterosexual matches.&nbsp;</p><p>Bumble has changed since 2014, though, and in case you're seeking answers on how Bumble works, look no further.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>How does Bumble work?</h2><p>In Bumble's early years, if you were a man matching with a woman, you had to wait until she messaged you first. But in April 2024, Bumble switched that up with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bumble-revamps-the-first-move-opening-moves-and-other-features" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Opening Moves</u></a>, a way for anyone to message anyone else first. (In gay matches, or with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bumble-nonbinary-users-message-first" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>nonbinary users</u></a>, that was typically the case before this.)</p><p>With Opening Move, any user could respond to a prompt on someone's Bumble profile for matches to respond to. (If you think this is similar to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-hinge-dating-app" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Hinge</u></a>, you're right. Recently, major <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tinder-bumble-hinge-are-collapsing-into-each-other" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>dating apps have added features</u></a> that other apps already have.)</p><p>Then, in October 2024, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bumble-expands-opening-moves-shortly-after-launch" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Bumble expanded Opening Moves</u></a> so users could add up to three prompts for matches to reply.</p><p>Any user can set an Opening Move.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to use Bumble</h2><p>First, you must create a profile on Bumble. Upload photos of yourself (<a href="https://support.bumble.com/hc/en-us/articles/28523708029341-Uploading-profile-photos" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Bumble recommends</u></a> four to six), fill out your personal details &mdash; such as your age and gender &mdash; and set your dating intentions and filters for what you're looking for. The more information you give, the likelier it is that the algorithm will serve profiles that fit what you want.</p><p>Once you create your Bumble profile, you can find potential matches in the People tab, located squarely in the center of the navigation panel at the bottom of the screen. Swipe right if you want to match, left if you don't. Once you match with someone, you can go to the Chat tab to start the conversation. (If you have a Premium account, you can also check out who's liked you first.)</p><p>Then there's the Discover tab, which is to the left of People. Bumble highlights four profiles it thinks you'll really like (or at least, its algorithm does). You can either Like these profiles or tell Bumble they're not for you. This selection of four refreshes daily at 9 a.m.</p><p>Unlike some other dating apps, <a href="https://support.bumble.com/hc/en-us/articles/28424238819357-Expired-matches" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>matches on Bumble expire</u></a> after 24 hours of matching unless someone messages. Free users can "extend" one match per day, but you have to pay for the app for more chances to extend matches.</p><p>As mentioned above, you can also set an Opening Move to give a match a chance to message once you match. With Opening  Moves, both people have to send a message, otherwise the chat will expire. </p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<h2>Is Bumble free?</h2><p>Bumble does have a free tier, and you don't have to pay anything to match and message people. But if you want extra perks, you'll have to pay.</p><p>As of late 2025, Bumble has three paid tiers: Boost, Premium, and Premium+. </p><p>"We are committed to delivering the best possible value for our members with our products and as a result pricing can vary by location," a spokesperson said.

<p>It's been six years since the Home Depot launched its 12-foot skeleton yard decoration to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/12-foot-home-depot-skeleton" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">viral, meme-ified acclaim</a>. And for the past five, "Skelly" has been impossible to find in stock around Halloween &mdash;&nbsp;much less on sale. This year, that finally changes.</p><p>As of Oct. 24, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj788L?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Home%20Depot%27s%2012-foot%20skeleton&object_type=article&object_uuid=06wfLOPCBrvNDAbhbxcO0bh&short_url=zj788L&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Home Depot's 12-foot skeleton</a> is marked down to just $149.98. That's a whopping 50% off its usual sticker price of $299 and the first I've ever seen it go on sale in all my years covering its <a href="https://mashable.com/article/home-depot-halfway-to-halloween-12-foot-skeleton-tariffs" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cult following</a>.</p><p>There's a catch, though: At the time of writing, the 12-footer wasn't available for delivery. You can only buy it for half off if you find it in stores, and you <em>can't</em> reserve it for pickup ahead of time &mdash;&nbsp;i.e., you'll have to go on a bit of a wild Skelly chase.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>This monitor has a 24.5-inch Full HD (1080p) Fast IPS panel with a 310Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time (GTG). Translation: motion should look incredibly smooth, and input lag minimal, which is exactly what you want for competitive shooters or racing games. It's also G-SYNC Compatible and features ASUS's ELMB Sync tech to further reduce motion blur and tearing.</p><p>It supports HDR400 for better contrast and brightness, covers 110 percent of the sRGB color space, and has a handy USB-C port that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode for a cleaner connection to laptops or other devices. The stand is fully adjustable (height, tilt, swivel, and pivot), and it even has a tripod socket if you want to mount a webcam directly to it. </p><p>For under $180, getting this level of speed and features from the ROG Strix lineup is a pretty great find.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The most-watched movie on Netflix proved such a smash hit that the streamer rolled out a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/kpop-demon-hunters-sing-along-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">sing-along theatrical release</a>, not once but <a href="https://mashable.com/article/k-pop-demon-hunters-sing-along-back-in-theaters-for-halloween" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">twice</a>! The soundtrack hit #1 on Billboard, with "Golden" becoming the longest-running #1 hit by a girl group on the Billboard Hot 100 in the 21st century. All of this is fueled by the fans. Love for <em>KPop Demon Hunters </em>is everywhere online, but perhaps it's most enthralling on TikTok, where fans share their excitement through singing, dancing, and cosplaying. Just like in the movie, the KPop Demon Hunters themselves love seeing their fans express themselves. </p><p>So, when Arden Cho and May Hong, who provide the voices for Rumi and Mira, came by Mashable's <a href="https://mashable.com/series/say-more" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Say More</a> studio, Entertainment Editor Kristy Puchko presented them with some of our team's favorite <em>KPop Demon Hunter </em>TikToks for their reactions. Whether it's a baby bopping to Saja Boys' "Soda Pop," a fleet of little Rumis, or cosplayers recreating even the quirkiest characters, Hong and Cho were elated, sharing their thoughts on each vid. </p><p>With Halloween around the corner, <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> fans will likely be out in force at costume parties and the return of the theatrical sing-along release.

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer.</p><p>If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Apple&rsquo;s noise cancellation surpasses Sony&rsquo;s, at least when it comes to wireless earbuds. The technology does away with nearly all low- and mid-frequency sounds. These buds handle high-frequency sounds better than the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-2-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>AirPods Pro 2</u></a>; sirens and whistles are barely audible. Transparency mode remains clutch for increasing ambient awareness. Also, modes like Conversation Boost allow you to communicate clearly without removing the buds. Much of the same can be said about the WF-1000xM5&rsquo;s adaptive noise cancellation, though its high-frequency reduction isn&rsquo;t as effective. Wind resistance is stronger on the WF-1000xM5.</p><p>Personalized Spatial Audio performs well on the AirPods Pro 3. Dolby Atmos content sounds immersive and natural. Effects and vocals are placed accurately on the soundscape and transition smoothly with every head gesture. Sony&rsquo;s 360 Reality Audio format does a convincing job of making music sound livelier. Sadly, the feature works with very few streaming platforms.</p><h3>Winner: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Translation-Headphones-High-Fidelity/dp/B0FQFB8FMG" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple AirPods Pro 3</u></a></h3><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-3" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Read our full review of the AirPods Pro 3</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>Audio quality and platform compatibility</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Sony&rsquo;s sound technologies are awesome. Its 8.4mm Dynamic Driver X units produce wide sound with enhanced bass and treble that blend beautifully with crisp mids and striking highs. The 10-band EQ with multiple well-engineered presets is perfect for personalizing sound. There&rsquo;s the Find Your EQ setting that tailors sound to your hearing. My favorite feature, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sony-headphones-dsee-extreme-feature" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>DSEE</u></a>, is essential for increasing fidelity on low-quality recordings. LDAC codec support boosts bitrate transmission to reveal more detail on tracks when streaming from DSPs (e.g, Apple Music, Spotify) via Android.</p><p>Speaking of which, the WF-1000xM5 easily pairs to Android and iOS/macOS devices. The Sony Sound Connect app is multi-platform and places all functionality at the tip of your finger.&nbsp;</p><p>The AirPods Pro 3 sound terrific out of the box (bass and highs are prominent). They just lack the WF-1000xM5&rsquo;s practical sound customization. Pairing to Android devices can be difficult at times, and about 70 percent of the buds&rsquo; features are restricted to iOS.&nbsp;</p><h3>Winner: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM5-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0C33XXS56" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Sony WF-1000xM5</u></a></h3><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Read our full review of the Sony WF-1000xM5</u></em></a><em>.</em>&nbsp;</p><h2>Where they meet in the middle</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Features are abundant on these two models. Many of the AirPods Pro 3&rsquo;s top perks were previously discussed, but there are extras worth mentioning, such as heart rate monitoring and Live Translation. Both features work surprisingly well. Other notables include audio sharing, auto switching, &ldquo;Hey Siri&rdquo; voice activation (iOS/macOS only), Personalized Volume, and Voice Isolation. The WF-1000xM5 receive many of the same features as the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/sony-wh-1000xm6-headphones" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>WH-1000xM6</u></a> headphones, from multi-level audio settings to smart controls (Quick Attention, Speak-to-Chat).</p><p>Comfort and fit are both hit and miss. While the AirPods Pro 3&rsquo;s new curvy sound port provides optimal fit, it feels unpleasant on the ear after three hours of wear. The WF-1000xM5&rsquo;s circular design is comfy, but it doesn&rsquo;t form a secure fit (many experts blame the bundled memory foam tips).</p><p>Battery life is almost identical. Both wireless charging cases hold up to 24 hours of listening time. A single charge offers 8 hours of ANC. The WF-1000xM5 can extend playtime to 12 hours when disabling ANC and special features, whereas the AirPods Pro 3 tap out at 10 hours. Charging times are faster on the WF-1000xM5: a 3-minute charge equals 3 hours of use. There is one caveat &mdash; you need a PD-compatible charger. The AirPods Pro 3 generate 1 hour on a 5-minute charge.</p><h3>Winner: Tie&nbsp;</h3><h2>And the winner is&hellip;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>It&rsquo;s too early to call this bout. Therefore, we&rsquo;re chalking it up to a tie, and for all the right reasons.</p><p>The addition of highly anticipated features and improvements to key areas (e.g, ANC, battery life) earns the AirPods Pro 3 high praise. As for the WF-1000xM5, they&rsquo;re still a force to be reckoned with, powered by singular proprietary technologies that deliver class-leading sound and equally great noise cancellation.</p><p>Your choice may come down to pricing. Apple&rsquo;s buds are the more affordable pair at $249. The current tariff fiasco has caused Sony to raise the WF-1000xM5&rsquo;s MSRP from $299 to $329. However, they are on sale frequently; Amazon had the buds priced at $190 during its <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-prime-day-travel-deals-2025-july-11" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>July Prime Day</u></a> event.</p><p>In the end, you&rsquo;re getting exceptional value from each model that no other luxury rival can match.&nbsp;</p><h3>Winner: Tie</h3>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As more and more companies switch to subscription-based models for their products, those $10 recurring fees add up &mdash; especially over a lifetime. So, what do you do? The answer is simple: invest upfront. And if you&rsquo;re someone who values your digital storage, right now&rsquo;s the time to invest. You can secure 50TB of digital storage thanks to a one-time payment of $699.99 (reg. $7,900) for <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrrLm?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Internxt%20Cloud%20Storage&object_type=article&object_uuid=02xfE1BJZMkTldMNFi2OCBE&short_url=zJrrLm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Internxt Cloud Storage</u></a>.</p><p>50TB of storage capacity gives you a lifetime&rsquo;s worth of space to back up all your favorite memories without having to pick and choose. Generally, 50 terabytes (TB) of cloud storage can hold nearly 1,000 full-length movies, or millions of photos and documents. While those numbers may vary on the file types and sizes, that&rsquo;s more than enough space. The next time you&rsquo;ll be hit with a &ldquo;low storage&rdquo; notification may be when you&rsquo;re old and gray.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

      <description><![CDATA[Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos' gnarly black comedy "Bugonia" is far from their best. Jesse Plemons co-stars in a weird remake. Review.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07sUPwfmxJycgygEWpgfXT7/hero-image.jpg" alt="Emma Stone stars as Michelle in director Yorgos Lanthimos' "Bugonia," a Focus Features release. "><p>There's actor/director pairings so strong that they come to define the core of both's filmographies: Alfred Hitchcock and Cary Grant, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, and now Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, the Greek director was on the rise before collaborating with Stone, having earned international critical acclaim for 2009's <em>Dogtooth</em>, and his first Oscar nomination (for Best Screenplay) for the Colin Farrell-fronted <em>The Lobster. </em>But it was when Lanthimos teamed up with Emma Stone for <em>The Favourite </em>that something changed. That bawdy sapphic comedy not only earned 10 Oscar nominations but also a win for leading lady Olivia Colman. Stone and Lanthimos' follow-up, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/poor-things-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Poor Things</em></a>,<em> </em>did even better while getting much wilder, combining the racy humor of <em>The Favourite</em> with the gut-churning science fiction of <em>Frankenstein. </em>Critical praise led to box office success, as well as 11 Oscar nominations and four wins, including Best Actress and Best Picture.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite its sex, violence, dark humor, and gore (or perhaps because of it), <em>Poor Things </em>became the pair's most popular movie to date. Props to them for challenging their audience with what would come next. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/kinds-of-kindness-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Kinds of Kindness</em></a><em> </em>offered a collection of uncomfortable and unconventional vignettes, involving a husband suspicious of his wife, a peculiar sex cult, and an unusual business arrangement. Critics were mixed and audiences didn't turn out. So what's next for this daring duo?&nbsp;</p><p><em>Bugonia, </em>a remake of Jang Joon-hwan's 2003 South Korean film <em>Save the Green Planet! </em>On its surface, it seems the kind of class conflict scenario that would play well to Stone and Lanthimos' shared cinematic interest. However, while screenwriter Will Tracy (<em>The Menu, The Regime</em>) makes some stark changes from Jang's script, the resulting film feels strangely safe, even as it's drenched in buzzwords and taboos.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Bugonia </em>explores the manosphere, conspiracy theories, and class conflict.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Jesse Plemons, who co-starred with Stone in <em>Kinds of Kindness</em>, stars as a beekeeper and conspiracy theorist named Teddy who's on a self-assigned mission to save his mother and the planet Earth. Living in a rotting family home that he shares with his impressionable cousin, Don (Aidan Delbis), Teddy is convinced that everything from the declining bee populations to his mother's comatose state are signs that extraterrestrial invaders are already here, plotting to destroy mankind.&nbsp;</p><p>Having identified pharmaceuticals CEO Michelle Fuller (Stone) as one of these aliens, Teddy convinces Don to assist him in a kidnapping plot that he hopes will put them in contact with the leader of the invaders for negotiation.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

His ability to use chloroform to knock her out and brute force to steal her from her home, shave her head (so her hair can't call for help to the mothership), and dress her in his mother's clothes are all victories for his mission.

<p>Far from being cowed by Teddy and Don's ambush or the many monologues about aliens and righteousness she's forced to listen to while in captivity, Michelle is cool and collected. She exudes calm and frustration, but not fear as she explains as if talking to a child that she is not an alien.&nbsp;</p><p>The battle of wills that follows is the core of <em>Bugonia. </em>Plemons, a profoundly skilled actor who can play sweethearts and scumbags with aplomb, plunges into Teddy with an ego-free abandon. Where Michelle is introduced as impeccably dressed in tailored business attire, clean girl makeup, and carefully coiffed hair, Teddy's mane is untamed, including a scruffy beard. And when Teddy wears a suit &mdash; to attempt to impress upon her his seriousness and status &mdash; it's battered and ill-fitting. Visually, he is a downtrodden buffoon. So, when he monologues, his appearance suggests he can't be taken seriously as he pontificates about the dangers of these high-and-mighty aliens, who don't care about the people of Earth because their power can always allow them to move on to another planet.&nbsp;</p><p>As Michelle, Stone plays patience for self-preservation, a deeply relatable survival tactic. But as Teddy becomes more threatening, Stone morphs into various manipulations, ranging from cajoling to threatening.&nbsp;</p><p>As in <em>Kinds of Kindness, </em>it's exciting to see these two scorching performers face off in a battle of wits, words, and wills. But frankly, it gets old. It likely didn't help my experience watching <em>Bugonia</em> that I'd seen <em>Save the Green Planet!, </em>so I had a strong idea of where the final act would go. Tracy and Lanthimos weave in bloody, wild new turns to the conclusion, but it doesn't make it fun or more profound. Instead, despite the star power, the dark sense of humor, the political commentary, and cat-and-mouse psychology between captive and captor, <em>Bugonia </em>becomes bogged down by sadness, or even hopelessness.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Bugonia </em>is a bummer. </h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The production design, presenting the contrast of rot and gloss, swiftly sets up the conflict between Teddy and Michelle. The color palette and its suffocating yellow cast suggest festering, potentially of Teddy's sanity or the world, and soon consumes even Michelle's once flawless appearance<strong>.</strong> But the buildup to the final act lacks momentum.</p><p>The scenes between Stone and Plemons don't so much build as they feel cyclical, until the wheels fall off, causing calamity. Maybe that's the point. Perhaps <em>Bugonia </em>is warning of the tedious runaround we as humans do day in and day out, arguing over who's right and who's wicked, the world and its people suffering all the while. Sure, the trailers for <em>Bugonia </em>set up the expectation for a thriller, focusing on the capture and the manhunt sure to follow for a "high-profile female executive." But mostly the movie is about who you're more comfortable believing. And within that, the political messaging gets muddy.&nbsp;</p><p>You might revisit <em>The Favourite </em>for the wickedly sharp barbs or the crazy chemistry between Colman, Stone, and Rachel Weisz. A <em>Poor Things </em>rewatch is an enthralling plunge into the compelling collision of beauty and ugliness, love and loss, luxury and poverty. <em>Kinds of Kindness</em> might still feel like an enigma we have not cracked. But <em>Bugonia, </em>despite having a sensational cast and clear vision for its world, lacks profundity in its smorgasbord of hot topics. Environmentalism, oligarchy, the manosphere, healthcare for profit &mdash; all of these make for a dizzying brew from which Teddy and Michelle arise on opposing sides. But what their battle ultimately means feels oddly remote after all the blood, sweat, tears, and chloroform.&nbsp;I was left feeling neither amused, elated, confounded or enraged, but just uncomfortably numb. </p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2w1r?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bugonia%20opens%20in%20select%20theaters%20on%20Oct.%2024.&object_type=article&object_uuid=07sUPwfmxJycgygEWpgfXT7&short_url=9l2w1r&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Bugonia </em>opens in select theaters on Oct. 24. </a></p>]]></content:encoded>

His quest for perfection in his work leads him to push away everyone around him, including his girlfriend, Faye (Odessa Young). He's also struggling with his mental health, bottling up his darker feelings and expressing them in his music.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Instead, when <em>Deliver Me From Nowhere </em>opens, Springsteen is already a star, growling out "Born to Run" in front of a rapturous crowd on his sold-out The River Tour.</p><p>Despite being a massive success, Springsteen is a troubled soul. He thinks often of his childhood &mdash; rendered in black and white in the film &mdash; primarily his relationship with his abusive father (<em>Adolescence</em>'s Stephen Graham) and concerned mother (Gaby Hoffmann). Between early concert footage and these flashbacks, <em>Deliver Me From Nowhere </em>falls quickly into clich&eacute;. But at least the film's concert and recording studio sessions provide it with a jolt of musical adrenaline.

<p>Springsteen's father's characterization boils down to the constant presence of a lit cigarette and a can of beer. Springsteen's mother is the stereotypical portrait of a woman trapped in a marriage with a dangerous man. The two scream at each other behind closed doors, the kind of scene that's been done to death. Yet it's this childhood and these relationships that serve as the bedrock of Springsteen's anxieties as he works on <em>Nebraska</em>. And because that past is so thinly drawn, the core of the movie falls flat.</p><h2><em>Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere </em>can't find the pain in the music.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>Deliver Me From Nowhere </em>uses the oldest tricks in the book to convey Springsteen's depression. He lays, despondent, around his rental house. He almost breaks down while driving, speeding his car toward oblivion before braking and letting out a yell. </p><p>Yet these images, while obvious signifiers of pain, lack a clear motivation. <em>Deliver Me From Nowhere </em>is always <em>telling </em>audiences that Springsteen is suffering. At one point, Springsteen mentions that when he goes home, "the quiet can get a little loud," a line that feels ripped straight from <em>The Bear</em>. Elsewhere, his music producer Jon Landau (Jeremy Strong) remarks on the feelings of guilt and shame Springsteen evokes in his <em>Nebraska </em>recordings. </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Neither the guilt nor the shame come through in Springsteen's writing and recording process, though. Instead, the process reads as simplistically linear: Springsteen watches Terrence Malick's <em>Badlands; </em>researches its real-life inspiration, murderer Charles Starkweather; then turns around and writes the song "Nebraska." He recalls his father taking him and his sister to play near a mansion on a hill, and boom, "Mansion on the Hill" is born. There are no surprises, no real discoveries about the emotions driving the music.</p><p><em>Don&rsquo;t miss out on our latest stories: <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=mashable.com" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Add Mashable as a trusted news source in Google</a></em><em>.</em></p><p>Even drama surrounding Springsteen's personal life and his relationship with Faye feels empty. Their early interactions are rife with sappy-sweet, contrived dialogue, while Springsteen's decision to distance himself from her rings hollow. A scene where Faye confronts Springsteen about how absent he is could easily be subbed out for Carmy and Claire's (Molly Gordon) confrontation from <em>The Bear </em>Season 4, and you'd have the same result.</p><h2>Jeremy Allen White delivers a great performance as Bruce Springsteen.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>As flawed as <em>Deliver Me From Nowhere </em>is, one area where it doesn't falter is the casting of White as Springsteen. Camouflaged somewhat behind a pair of brown contacts and some sideburns, White channels Springsteen's melancholy with the same careful vulnerability that earned him an Emmy for <em>The Bear</em>. Make no mistake, though. While the arcs of both Carmy and Springsteen are oddly similar, these are not copycat performances.</p><p>White's Carmy so often feels on the verge of exploding with anger or grief, while his Springsteen carries a steady sadness with him at all times. If Carmy is a pressure cooker, Springsteen is a deep lake.</p><p>White brings his all to <em>Deliver Me From Nowhere</em>'s many musical scenes, singing Springsteen's hits and the occasional cover song at the Stone Pony until veins pop out of his neck and his face is covered in sweat. Does his own singing match up seamlessly with the Boss's? No way. But the swelling energy of the concert sequences and White's full-throated commitment bring the performances home.</p><p>Still, White does his best work in <em>Deliver Me From Nowhere</em>'s quietest moments. In one sequence, he sits in silence for a good long while before his face crumples and he lets out great, heaving sobs. It's an astounding moment of catharsis, and further proof of White's ability as a performer to bring deep sorrow to life. If only the rest of <em>Deliver Me From Nowhere </em>had the emotional heft to back that sequence up.</p><p><em>Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere </em>was reviewed out of the New York Film Festival. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKqX8B?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=It%20hits%20theaters%20Oct.%2024.&object_type=article&object_uuid=07LFRG6AZAiRihjWlwAoDaE&short_url=QKqX8B&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">It hits theaters Oct. 24.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

What could you possibly do to stop it? Or failing that, what unfinished business would you want to tackle? This is the nauseating question at the center of <em>A House of Dynamite. </em>Academy Award&ndash;winning director Kathryn Bigelow (<em>The Hurt Locker</em>) teams with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/zero-day-review-robert-de-niro-netflix" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Zero Day</em></a><em> </em>writer Noah Oppenheim &mdash;&nbsp;and an all-star cast &mdash; to show what it might look like if one of the United States' enemies launched a missile at one of our nation's major cities.&nbsp;</p><p>In the blink of an eye, soldiers, politicians, and government officials go from having a totally run-of-the-mill day to participating in a moment that will define the lives of millions, in the U.S. and abroad. And all their decisions must happen in a 19-minute window.&nbsp;</p><p>Idris Elba stars as the president of the United States, while the rest of his team (and beyond) is brought to life by Rebecca Ferguson, Greta Lee, Anthony Ramos, Gabriel Basso, Jared Harris, Moses Ingram, Jason Clarke, Ren&eacute;e Elise Goldsberry, Kaitlyn Dever, and Tracy Letts. But make no mistake, this is not the kind of American movie that cheers, "Here comes POTUS to save the world." </p><p>Bigelow's work, which ranges from the trippy <em>Strange Days </em>and the propulsive <em>Point Break </em>to the intense <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> and the earnest <em>Detroit,</em> isn't interested in feel-good fantasies. What she delivers with <em>A House of Dynamite </em>is a passionate and powerful call to disarm. But be warned, the movie around this message is nerve-shredding and pretty infuriating.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>A House of Dynamite </em>plays out a nightmare scenario in a tense triptych.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Bigelow's latest film begins in Washington, D.C., on a sunny morning in which a flood of government workers casually go through security protocols to take up their positions at monitoring devices and computer screens. They carry baubles of their personal lives: an engagement ring ready to be proposed with, a small toy dinosaur from a flu-ish little boy, a cellphone ablaze with a photo of loved ones. These tokens of the world outside their cold situation rooms illustrate what each person here works for. Beyond the paycheck to cover the costs of apartments and doctors' appointments, their edict to make the world a better place means keeping the U.S. safe for the pregnant wife, sick son, or estranged daughter who has no idea what the sausage of peacemaking looks like.&nbsp;</p><p>In a bustling first act, Oppenheim's script efficiently sketches out an array of characters who collaborate across situation rooms, secured phone lines, and crowded video calls to handle any crisis that hits. Yet the main focus of this section is Captain Olivia Walker (Rebecca Ferguson), a mom who relishes playing with her kid and giving motherly advice to a younger co-worker, but is all business in the White House Situation Room when news of the mysterious missile arrives. Not long after the bomb appears on their tracking screens, a voice over the conference call estimates 19 minutes until impact.&nbsp;</p><p>This 19-minute window plays out in each section, focusing on a different group with a different character taking the lead. So just as <em>A House of Dynamite </em>nears the final countdown in the first act, it leaps back 20 minutes for a chapter called "Hitting a Bullet with a Bullet." The second act focuses on new-to-the-department Deputy National Security Advisor Jake Baerington (Gabriel Basso), who has the comically embarrassing distinction of being late to work on the biggest day of his life. </p><p>That means he's taking this world-defining Zoom call from his cellphone while racing to the office. While every other window is black in privacy mode or showing some grave general or another, Baerington's is at an unflattering low angle, shaking as he hustles to his station. In chapter one, that's actually pretty funny. But in chapter two, his frantic running is stressful because we already understand what is at stake. From there, he is our guide into the sweaty calls to foreign diplomats, trying to suss out who launched this missile so that the president might know how to best proceed.&nbsp;Then once again, as we near the end of the countdown, the clock resets.</p><p>The third chapter, titled "A House Full of Dynamite" (instead of <em>A House of Dynamite</em>) shifts to the president (Elba). For the first two-thirds of the film, he was only heard over the conference call. Now, what he's been up to is finally revealed. But this chapter is where the film begins to fall apart. </p><h2><em>A House of Dynamite </em>is suffocatingly tense, until it's just not.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>For the first chapter, disembodied voices shout expository lines about the bomb's trajectory, timing, and likely kill count. As the movie progresses and the timeline resets, these voices become on-camera characters whose stories give greater context to their answers. It's an effective approach by Oppenheim, as we &mdash;&nbsp;like the characters &mdash;&nbsp;experience the first act bewildered by the news and the sheer flood of it. With the second and then the third act, we're not only teased with the catastrophic impact three times, but we're also given space to step back and better understand the possibilities of what comes next. It's a lecture, but exciting &mdash;&nbsp;even if all the answers boil down to "nothing good!"&nbsp;</p><p>However, with a 112-minute runtime, <em>A House of Dynamite </em>tries our patience. The third act splits focus, revealing what's been going on with the president and the secretary of defense (Jared Harris). What was character-building in the first two acts feels like filler as we, the audience, grow more and more eager to see how this is going to turn out. The third act picks back up as these men make a move. Though not sharing the screen, Elba and Harris deliver performances that swiftly show the strain of these decisions, coupled with the tenderness that makes them impossible.&nbsp;</p><p>To the credit of a sensational cast, the vexing pace of <em>A House of Dynamite</em>'s final act is nearly made bearable because of their performances. The film zips from military installations around the world, grappling with this disaster. Yet Bigelow's clarity of vision keeps clear who is who and what is what. But at a certain point, <em>A House of Dynamite </em>becomes intentionally aggravating.&nbsp;</p><h2>You'll hate the ending of <em>A House of Dynamite. </em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I predict audiences will hate this ending, as I hated this ending. But I'll say this: It makes sense.&nbsp;</p><p>With <em>A House of Dynamite</em>, Oppenheim and Bigelow set out to explain in a big, flashy Hollywood fashion exactly what a catastrophe a nuclear war would be. They basically give us plenty of sugar through star power and suspense to help the medicine go down. </p><p>Perhaps every generation since the atom bomb's creation has needed such a reminder in compelling art. Watching this movie, I thought a lot about the novel <em>Alas, Babylon</em> by Pat Frank, which I read in high school and still think of, probably too often. <em>A House of Dynamite</em> shows us a noble, handsome collection of soldiers and public servants coming together to protect the nation, its people, and their own families. And all the safeguards that are set up to make sure the worst won't happen are not enough to guarantee it won't happen.&nbsp;</p><p><em>A House of Dynamite</em> gets finger-waggy in its anti-nuclear arms messaging. But that's not the frustrating bit. Bigelow and Oppenheim set up a feast of big questions. It's not that they've bitten off more than they can chew, but that they've decided it's not for them to chew. With this frustrating finale, they leave us without answers, forced to find our own.</p><p>While <em>A House of Dynamite </em>will have a brief theatrical run, as a Netflix original it will chiefly be watched at home. How much time for meditation on the movie's message will at-home audiences have before the streaming service switches over to an algorithm-approved bit of entertainment to distract us?</p><p><em> A House of Dynamite</em> <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwLKw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=debuts%20on%20Netflix%20on%20Oct.%2024.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05Y9cdmPrFOZ3oFaHTsbCwd&short_url=akwLKw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">debuts on Netflix on Oct. 24.</a></p><p class="mx-auto">

      <description><![CDATA["Shelby Oaks," the first film from YouTube reviewer Chris Stuckmann, includes influences ranging from "The Blair Witch Project" to "Barbarian."]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00VzU5sMyQVHpJ4uhEAMozU/hero-image.jpg" alt="A woman holds out a photograph in "Shelby Oaks.""><p>Can a great horror movie be Frankensteined together from a laundry list of iconic ones? That's what I'm left pondering after watching <em>Shelby Oaks</em>, the promising and oft unnerving but also somewhat scattered first feature from popular YouTube movie reviewer Chris Stuckmann.</p><p>The movie starts out convincing you it's one thing, but reveals itself in quick succession to be a very different beast altogether. From <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> to <em>Martyrs</em> to <em>Barbarian</em> and several beyond that, <em>Shelby Oaks</em> doesn't just wear its many genre influences on its sleeves &mdash;&nbsp;it wears them on its chest and back and shoulders. It's a coat of many horror movies, made of cuts deep and broad. And, to ever so slightly belabor the metaphor, some of the coat fits just right, while as much of it could use some more refined tailoring.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, as far as Kickstarter-funded first features go, <em>Shelby Oaks</em> is a big, bold swing &mdash; albeit one produced by horror honcho Mike Flanagan, the man behind a swath of Netflix horror miniseries like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/haunting-hill-house-domestic-horror-love" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Haunting of Hill House</em></a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-fall-of-the-house-of-usher-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Fall of the House of Usher</em></a>. It's twisty as hell, bears some ace performances, and truly gifts audiences with some very sticky and very spooky images. Most of all, it marks the emergence of a horror filmmaker worth keeping an eye on.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Shelby Oaks</em> blends <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> with <em>Lake Mungo</em> &mdash; and that's just the start.</h2><p>"Who took Riley Brennan?" is the question at the heart of <em>Shelby Oaks.</em> The film opens with the last known bit of footage of Riley Brennan (Sarah Durn), YouTuber/ghost hunter, before she went missing in the titular town. In the scene, she sits on a bed in a cabin in the middle of the woods. She's seen sobbing, absolutely terrified, saying into the camera, "I'm so scared."</p><p>It's an inch-long leap from Riley's tearful lament to Heather Donahue's legendarily snotty apologia in <em>The Blair Witch Project,</em> the one that poetically stated, "I'm scared to close my eyes, and I'm scared to open them."</p><p>Writer-director Stuckmann anticipates his horror-loving audience will make this connection. But then he does something really interesting, pivoting from the found-footage conceit to a true-crime documentary framework. Leaping to a decade or so after Riley's disappearance, it turns out that Riley's older sister, Mia (Camille Sullivan), has spent the intervening years fruitlessly searching for the truth of what happened in the woods of Shelby Oaks that night. And she's now starring in a true-crime documentary in an effort to reignite interest in the case of her missing sister.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For horror fanatics, this turn might well recall <em>Lake Mungo</em>. Told via talking-head interviews with the family of the missing blonde girl at its center, the 2008 Australian horror film unfurls its paranormal revelations piecemeal through conversations and scattered bits of phone video. <em>Lake Mungo</em> is admittedly a deeper cut than <em>The Blair Witch Project, </em>but no sooner does <em>Shelby Oaks </em>settle into this faux-documentary conceit than Stuckmann pivots again to a straightforward narrative film. Well, it's as straightforward as the twisty likes of <em>Hereditary </em>or <em>Barbarian.</em></p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Essentially, <em>Shelby Oaks </em>maintains its cast, but ditches the documentary framework altogether, showing us what is "really" happening &mdash; but through artifice, forcing us to question what is real. The camerawork becomes stylized, with special effects and slow motion and close-ups; an aggressive and manipulative score takes over. The film will shift from these narrative scenes to the documentary setup to found footage and back again, maximizing this sense of narrative disquiet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These structural sleights of hands, like all good and proper rug-pullings, are where <em>Shelby Oaks</em> works its greatest magic. Playing on the expectations of horror diehards, Stuckmann manages to keep us on our toes, even discombobulated. We find ourselves switching between missing-person found footage to the cult horror of <em>Hereditary</em> with the twists and turns (and hidden underground caverns) of <em>Martyrs</em> and <em>Barbarian</em>, and then right back to a talking-head true-crime doc on a dime. This all builds up its own sort of disassociation within the experience of watching it.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Shelby Oaks</em> is a hodgepodge of horror, from found footage to Satanic panic.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Despite these daring shifts, <em>Shelby Oaks</em> begins to feel more like the parts of its sum and not vice versa. Stuckmann is motioning toward all of these other movies to unmoor us, but those references often distract from the actual plot and, in turn, undermine our investment in it. For instance, the casting of&nbsp;Brendan Sexton III as Mia's husband proves distracting, even though he's terrific. An actor who's been killing it since Todd Solondz's 1995 hit, <em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em>, Sexton turns in yet another lovely, sad piece of work here. But you set him against multiple scenes that take place inside of a haunted prison, and now all I'm thinking about is <em>Session 9</em>, Brad Anderson's fantastically creepy 2001 haunted prison movie, where Sexton made a mark as one of the asbestos cleaners who found himself on the wrong end of some rusty psychiatric equipment.</p><p>To what end is this? At what point do these Easter eggs overwhelm? All these allusions ultimately get in the way of <em>Shelby Oaks </em>standing on its own and becoming truly, deeply scary. Stuckmann seems very aware of the exact moment when his scares are supposed to land, often to the point of self-consciousness. You could set a timer to when the thing you're supposed to be dreading will appear, and the dreaded thing will stick that mark every time. There are moments when a zag would've kicked the ass of a zig, but Stuckmann keeps on zigging, playing right into horror connoisseur expectations. There is real, earned tension, but the film keeps deflating itself despite the fun of its reality-shifting and the many excellent go-for-broke performances therein.&nbsp;</p><h2>Camille Sullivan leads a cast that fights valiantly for <em>Shelby Oaks</em>.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>An actor who's been nipping at the edges of recognition for two decades, appearing in TV shows from <em>Dark Angel </em>to <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, Camille Sullivan has long proven a reliable performer. And here at last she is given the spotlight to make the most of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Even when Mia starts doing incredibly stupid things that put her right in harm's way, Sullivan is genuinely devastating. She sells the hell out of bad choices, making it clear that Mia's a person who would go to any lengths to uncover what happened to her beloved sister. (And as long as we're talking references, besides this being the lead's arc in that French Extremity classic <em>Martyrs,</em> it's straight out of the terrifying 1988 Dutch thriller <em>The Vanishing</em>,<em> </em>too.)&nbsp;</p><p>Sullivan nails big action moments, like emotional blowups and freak-outs in which her palpable fright is legitimately difficult to look at. But even the small moments give her opportunities to send shivers. Just watch the way the flashlight trembles in her hand as she investigates that haunted prison, a subtle shift in body language that communicates a bone-deep terror. It's those touches that carry the audience alongside Mia the entire way.&nbsp;</p><p>Sarah Durn is also haunting as missing girl Riley, who has to sell her undoing while staring off into space during the "naturalistic" found-footage portions of this movie. These are scenes we keep coming back to to see more of as, natch, more footage gets found, and her haunted presence diffuses into every corner of the film. As we know from decades of subpar found-footage movies, it's not easy, this high-wire balancing act of giving a relaxed and unprofessional-seeming performance under those constraints. Loads have failed spectacularly. But Durn makes us understand why her sister won't let her go even as everyone else has long given up. She makes Riley our ghost, too.</p><p>The whole ensemble expertly submerges into the multiple realities of this story. Even if Stuckmann needs to get a little bit out of his own way in some other areas, he proves to be terrific with his performers. Sullivan and Sexton share some very moving moments together as they watch their marriage crumble in the face of tragedy. Michael Beach wears a bone-deep exhaustion in his performance as the main detective on the case, giving a lived-in sense of resignation at the system's endless failures. And Keith David (the deep-voiced legend from <em>The Thing</em> and <em>They Live</em>, among many) shows up to Keith David it out of the park, playing the former warden of that haunted prison who has seen some shit and who, in typical fashion, is going to colorfully monologue to you all about it.&nbsp;</p><p>But best of all is the great and notoriously underused Robin Bartlett. One of those stalwart character actors with decades of stealing scenes under their belts (she's been doing it since <em>Heaven's Gate</em> in 1980, but I always first think of her hilarious scenes around the dinner table in <em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em> whenever I see her), Bartlett shows up and gives the movie a last-act goose that takes it over the edge into true unhinged horror-movie delight. More I cannot and will not spoil, except to say that yes, this is how you give Robin Bartlett her due. She ends up stealing &mdash; and in so doing, <em>making</em> &mdash; the entire movie.</p><p>Playing like a post-post-modern pastiche, an ouroboros of antecedents, and sometimes just a wicked walk through a nightmare wasteland, <em>Shelby Oaks</em> has enough gas in its tank for 10 movies. That it sometimes feels like 10 movies we've seen before is both part of its weird ballsy charm and its scrappy undoing. In the end, <em>Shelby Oaks </em>is a battle between Stuckmann's many, many inspirations. But the gripping performances and big swings in style make for a movie worth its runtime. Despite its faults, the directorial debut should prove a hell of a calling card for Chris Stuckmann as a new voice in horror. I can't wait to see what he delivers to us next.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9211qD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Shelby%20Oaks%20is%20in%20theaters%20now.&object_type=article&object_uuid=00VzU5sMyQVHpJ4uhEAMozU&short_url=9211qD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Shelby Oaks</em> is in theaters now.</a> </p><p class="mx-auto">

<p><em>Counter-Strike 2 </em>skins are virtual items which change a player character's appearance. Players can get these cosmetics by using in-game Keys to open in-game Cases. Such Cases can be earned simply by playing, while Keys must be purchased with real money. The skins players receive from Cases are randomised, making it difficult to get rare cosmetics.</p><p>Rare items are highly coveted by <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> players, and can sell for hundreds or even <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/counter-strike-2/most-expensive-cs2-csgo-skins-1340162/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">thousands of real-world dollars</a> on third-party cosmetic marketplaces &mdash; well above <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/61F0-72B7-9A18-C70B" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the official Steam Community Market's $1,800 price cap</a>.

However, we have you covered! Below are piecemeal answers that will serve as hints so that you can find your way through each difficulty level.</p><h2>How to play Pips</h2><p>If you've ever played dominoes, you'll have a passing familiarity for how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/pips" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pips</a> is played. As we've shared in our previous hints stories for Pips, the tiles, like dominoes, are placed vertically or horizontally and connect with each other. The main difference between a traditional game of dominoes and Pips is the color-coded conditions you have to address. The touching tiles don't necessarily have to match.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>The conditions you have to meet are specific to the color-coded spaces. For example, if it provides a single number, every side of a tile in that space must add up to the number provided. It is possible &ndash; and common &ndash; for only half a tile to be within a color-coded space.</p><p>Here are common examples you'll run into across the difficulty levels:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Number</strong>: All the pips in this space must add up to the number.</p></li><li><p><strong>Equal</strong>: Every domino half in this space must be the same number of pips.</p></li><li><p><strong>Not Equal</strong>: Every domino half in this space must have a completely different number of pips.</p></li><li><p><strong>Less than</strong>: Every domino half in this space must add up to less than the number.</p></li><li><p><strong>Greater than:</strong> Every domino half in this space must add up to more than the number.</p></li></ul><p>If an area does not have any color coding, it means there are no conditions on the portions of dominoes within those spaces.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>What is <em>Connections: Sports Edition</em>?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has launched in association with <em>The Athletic</em>, the New York Times property that provides the publication's sports coverage. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-october-17-2025" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" title="(Opens in a new tab)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

</blockquote>

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer.</p><p>If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake &mdash; players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

      <description><![CDATA[With plenty of scams hiding in plain sight, it’s time to protect yourself (and emails) from potential threats.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01VH0P5lZ1VOmc2AKooE28r/hero-image.jpg" alt="phishing email"><p>Encrypted emails are the oldest trick in the book. These scams can often appear as messages from close relationships, deal opportunities, lottery winnings, or lost inheritance. They may even look like a simple social media notification (with a secret phishing scam buried just beneath the surface). While you might think you can easily spot and avoid potential threats from snatching your information, these emails can slip past even the most observant of people.</p><p>For as many phishing scams as you avoid, more are sent back into its place. Falling for one of these &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; emails allows scammers to access your personal information for their own nefarious purposes. Though fear not, there&rsquo;s an easy solution to this common problem. Let us show you how to spot these fake emails and save yourself from being their next victim.</p><h3>The fake email scam</h3><p>Fake emails vary in terms of realism. Each made to sound personal or professional depending on the target, these emails might use business and government logos or typography in order to sell the ruse. Fake emails may even pretend to be your closest friends and family in order to trick you.</p><p>Though you can try to find amateur details to uncover their true nature, here are several types of fake email scams you should be on the look out for first:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Impersonisation: </strong>Impersonation scams will pretend to be businesses, government or charitable organisations, celebrities, or friends and family, to lure you in. Then through links or downloadable attachments, scammers can install malware onto your device. They may even try intimidation or emotional manipulation tactics to convince you to log into your personal accounts or send through money.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unexpected Money: </strong>Probably, the most well-known email scam. Unexpected money scams will try to convince you of winnings, rebates, or inheritance, you could access at the push of a button. Then to take hold of your winnings or inheritance, scammers will try to convince you to pay administration fees or taxes through your bank details.</p></li><li><p><strong>Victim of Identity Crime</strong>: These email scams will try and persuade you that you&rsquo;ve been a victim of a previous crime. Scammers prey on your fear of identity theft to convince you that they can help recover any lost money or compensation, if you simply send them your personal details.</p></li></ul><h3>How to spot a fake email</h3><p>Some emails may be very convincing, yet there are still a few details that will give them away. From changes in tone of voice to strange fee requests, not every scammer has the means to keep their bases covered. So If any suspicious emails make their way into your inbox, here are some common signs to look out for:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Requests personal details: </strong>No legitimate organisation will ask you for payment over email or phone call. If you&rsquo;ve been sent an email asking for your BSB and account number or a payment link to input them, you&rsquo;re more than likely about to fall for a scam. Avoid theft attempts by refusing to hand over your personal bank details.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unusual links or attachments: </strong>A scammers favourite way to install viscous malware, clicking any links or attachments on suspicious emails will endanger your devices. Forego any requests from emails that you do not fully trust. Though if you happen to click before you realise, do not enter in any personal details.</p></li><li><p><strong>Free webmail address: </strong>Most businesses and government organisations will not have free email addresses (such as @outlook.com or @gmail.com). So if you stumble across an email from a business or government organisation asking you to input your details, check the email address before you do anything.</p></li><li><p><strong>Threats of violence or retaliation: </strong>Often, scammers may resort to threats or retaliation tactics to scare victims into submission. You will notice a shift in tone as they may try to intimidate you with threats of violence, deportation, or potential arrest. Though these emails may make their nefarious purposes crystal-clear, if you&rsquo;re still unsure, you can reach out to the real organisation via phone to confirm.</p></li></ul><h3>Try Bitdefender protection</h3><p>While you can do everything in your power to avoid scammers, you may need an extra layer of defense to block phishing attempts from your inbox. Bitdefender has an array of security products and services that&rsquo;ll keep you fully protected:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-au/consumer/total-security" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Bitdefender Total Security</a>: Generous protection against viral threats, Bitdefender Total Security includes cross-platform protection for multiple devices.

For the final hurdle, every correct answer from previous hurdles is shown, with correct and misplaced letters clearly shown.</p><p>An important note is that the number of times a letter is highlighted from previous guesses does necessarily indicate the number of times that letter appears in the final hurdle. </p><p>If you find yourself stuck at any step of today's Hurdle, don't worry!

We're on day three of the new lunar cycle, so keep reading to find out what this means.</p><h2>What is today&rsquo;s moon phase?</h2><p>As of Friday, Oct. 24, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ispace-moon-lander-south-pole-image" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">moon </a>phase is Waxing Crescent. There will be 8% of the moon lit up tonight, according to <a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/moon-observation/daily-moon-guide/?intent=011" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NASA's Daily Moon Observation</a>.</p><p>But sadly there's still too little lit up to see anything. Check back tomorrow.</p><h2>When is the next full moon?</h2><p>The next full moon will be on Nov. 5. </p><h2>What are moon phases?</h2><p>According to <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/moon/moon-phases/#hds-sidebar-nav-9" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NASA</a>, moon phases, like Waxing Crescent, are caused by the 29.5-day cycle of the moon&rsquo;s orbit. The cycle occurs when the angles between the Sun, Moon, and Earth change. Moon phases are how the moon looks from Earth as it goes around us. We always see the same side of the moon, but how much of it is lit up by the Sun changes depending on where it is in its orbit. This is how we get full moons, half moons, and moons that appear completely invisible. There are eight main moon phases, and they follow a repeating cycle.</p><p>The eight main moon phases are:</p><p>New Moon - The moon is between Earth and the sun, so the side we see is dark (in other words, it's invisible to the eye).</p><p>Waxing Crescent - A small sliver of light appears on the right side (Northern Hemisphere).</p><p>First Quarter - Half of the moon is lit on the right side. It looks like a half-moon.</p><p>Waxing Gibbous - More than half is lit up, but it&rsquo;s not quite full yet.</p><p>Full Moon - The whole face of the moon is illuminated and fully visible.</p><p>Waning Gibbous - The moon starts losing light on the right side. (Northern Hemisphere)</p><p>Third Quarter (or Last Quarter) - Another half-moon, but now the left side is lit.</p><p>Waning Crescent - A thin sliver of light remains on the left side before going dark again.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Well, let's talk about the mechanical arm. The included grabby arm, as we affectionately call it, picks up objects, whether it be a stray sock or shoe, and moves them to their designated home. But how does this feature actually fair? It's just okay &mdash; and our reviewer actually recommends turning it off.</p><p>Otherwise, the device still has powerful suction and scrubbing action, making it a solid combo robot vacuum and mop. While we didn't think it was worth its $2,599 MSRP, it's more worthy of its discounted price of $1,399.99 at Amazon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Spanning early hackers of the 1970s to today's sophisticated ransomware organizations that steal over $150 million every day, the exhibit allows the public to visualize faceless crimes. The highlight of "Digital Underground" is a live cyberthreat map displaying attacks happening in real-time. A large wall mural and panel describe how these criminal enterprises operate and continue to proliferate around the world, with corporations and government bodies facing about 1,900 cyberattacks a week.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>"Cybercrime has become one of the most pressing, pervasive and profitable threats of our time," Geoff Schumacher, The Mob Museum's Vice President of Exhibits and Programs, said in a statement. "'Digital Underworld' provides important historical context, compelling artifacts and a live look at how these crimes are carried out today, making it clear that organized crime is no longer limited to the streets, it thrives in the digital world."</p><p>In 2023, a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/moodys-says-breach-mgm-is-credit-negative-disruption-lingers-2023-09-13/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">huge cyberattack crippled MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment</a>, both of which operate the largest casino resorts in Las Vegas.

Now, <a href="https://mashable.com/category/samsung" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung</a> is trying to succeed where even Apple has failed.</p><p>The Korean tech giant launched the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/project-moohan-samsung-xr-headset-launch-specs-pricing" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Galaxy XR</a> headset this week, which is, in some senses, a competitor for the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/meta-quest-3" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Meta Quest 3</a>. However, Samsung's new XR headset and Meta's slightly older one are very different products, in plenty of ways. That's where we come in.</p><p>Here's how the Samsung Galaxy XR and Meta Quest 3 specs, price, and key features compare.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy XR vs. Meta Quest 3: Price</h2><p>Perhaps the most stark difference between these two devices, both of which nominally offer similar XR experiences, is the price. Let's get right to it: The Galaxy XR costs $1,799. Meta Quest 3, on the other hand, starts at $499. That's a <em>huge</em> difference, so much so that you almost have to wonder if these two devices are really competitors. To be clear, they are, but Meta's headset is definitely going to be a more mainstream-friendly option due to how much cheaper it is.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy XR vs. Meta Quest 3: Specs</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The gap in price can be accounted for when you see the specs. Here are the Galaxy XR's basic specs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Two micro-OLED displays with 3552x3840 resolution per eye and up to 90Hz refresh rate</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chipset</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>109-degree horizontal, 100-degree vertical field of view</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Eye tracking and iris recognition included</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>256GB storage</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>16GB RAM</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>545g weight</strong></p></li></ul><p>And here are the equivalent specs on Quest 3:</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<ul><li><p><strong>Two LCD displays with 2064x2208 resolution per eye and up to 120Hz refresh rate</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>103.8 degree horizontal, 96.4 degree vertical field of view</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>No eye tracking</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>512GB storage</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>8GB RAM</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>515g weight</strong></p></li></ul><p>It all starts with the displays. Galaxy XR's two displays are higher-end OLED panels with <em>substantially</em> higher resolutions than what you get on Quest 3. The refresh rate is lower, though the difference between 90Hz and 120Hz is not hugely noticeable for the average person. You also get a newer chip powering the Galaxy XR, as well as twice as much RAM, though how its performance differs from Quest 3 in practice remains to be seen.</p><p>Samsung's device also comes with eye tracking, which is pretty important for a headset. On the flipside, Quest 3 is a little bit lighter and actually comes with more onboard storage. Those are the only real advantages, though. It should also be noted that Galaxy XR runs on the Android XR operating system, while Quest 3 runs on Meta's proprietary OS. That means they won't necessarily support the same games and apps.</p><p>Oh, and the Galaxy XR also has six motion-tracking cameras, as opposed to four on the Quest 3. Again, we can't say for sure how much that matters in practical terms, but it is a difference worth noting.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy XR vs. Meta Quest 3: Controllers</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl">

<p>Both of these devices support hand tracking, meaning you don't necessarily <em>need</em> controllers, but those help a lot when it comes to playing VR games and whatnot. The good news is that Meta Quest 3 comes with two controllers, featuring a standard lineup of buttons, motion tracking, and analog sticks, right in the box.</p><p>The bad news? Galaxy XR doesn't come with controllers. There are Galaxy XR-specific controllers available for sale, but they cost $249. It's not certain yet just how necessary these are for full enjoyment of the Galaxy XR, but just know that if you want the full experience, you're going to end up quadrupling the price of a Quest 3.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy XR vs. Meta Quest 3: Battery life</h2><p>Samsung rates the Galaxy XR headset for up to 2 hours of general use and up to 2.5 hours of video playback. That's obviously not great, but it's pretty normal for an XR headset. Meta, meanwhile, rates the Quest 3 for 2.2 hours of usage, so there isn't really a big difference here. One would hope that the nearly $2,000 device would have a meaningfully better battery than the $500 one, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.</p><p>There will surely be more differences between these two devices that are worth highlighting once the Galaxy XR is in our hands, but for now, it seems like the Galaxy XR is much more tuned to enthusiasts and early adopters, while the Meta Quest 3 is for a more general audience.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-6 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-10 md:border-b-2 md:border-gray-100">

<p>The stage is set. The defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers will face the Toronto Blue Jays in the 2025 World Series to see which team will take home the trophy. The Dodgers beat the Yankees in 2024 to take home their second title this decade (eighth overall), while the Blue Jays haven't seen a World Series since 1993. Whichever team you're rooting for, it's sure to be a dramatic week (or more) of games.</p><p>Lucky for baseball fans, watching the postseason is a whole lot easier than&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-watch-mlb-2025-season" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">watching regular-season games</a>. You can even watch for free with some strategic planning. We've rounded up the best ways to watch the World Series for free below. Let's play ball.</p><h2>When is the 2025 World Series?</h2><p>The 2025 World Series schedule is as follows:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Game 1</strong> &mdash; Friday, Oct. 24 at 8 p.m. ET in Toronto</p></li><li><p><strong>Game 2 </strong>&mdash; Saturday, Oct. 25 at 8 p.m. ET in Toronto</p></li><li><p><strong>Game 3 </strong>&mdash; Monday, Oct. 27 at 8 p.m. ET in Los Angeles</p></li><li><p><strong>Game 4</strong> &mdash; Tuesday, Oct. 28 at 8 p.m. ET in Los Angeles</p></li><li><p><strong>Game 5</strong> (if necessary) &mdash; Wednesday, Oct. 29 at 8 p.m. in Los Angeles</p></li><li><p><strong>Game 6</strong> (if necessary) &mdash; Friday, Oct. 31 at 8 p.m. in Toronto</p></li><li><p><strong>Game 7</strong> (if necessary) &mdash; Saturday, Nov. 1 at 8 p.m. in Toronto</p></li></ul><h2>What channel will the 2025 World Series be on?</h2><p>Since the early 2000s, the World Series has been exclusively on Fox &mdash;&nbsp;and this year is no different. You can <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-streaming-sites-live-sports" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">watch the games play out live</a> on your local Fox network if you have cable.</p><h2>Can I watch the World Series without cable?</h2><p>You have a couple of different options to access Fox in 2025 without cable: a digital antenna, a Fox One subscription, or a cable replacement service. Each option has its pros and cons, of course, so we'll leave it up to you to decide what's best for your situation. </p><p>A <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-indoor-tv-antenna/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">digital antenna</a> is a relatively cheap (generally between $25 and $40) way to gain access to your local TV stations, but you need to be within a certain radius of the stations themselves and free of obstructions in order to get a clear broadcast. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/fox-one-streaming-service-announcement" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Fox One</a> subscriptions give you access to your local Fox station and so much more &mdash;&nbsp;it's a one-stop shop for the entirety of the Fox TV portfolio. It's a great choice for sports fans in general, but it might be overkill if you just want access to your local station. </p><p>Finally, a cable replacement service (like YouTube TV or Hulu + Live TV) gives you access to 100+ live TV channels, including Fox. If you want a long-term way to watch live broadcasts, these are pretty well-rounded options that still cost less than cable. But that doesn't mean they're cheap.</p><h2>How to watch the World Series for free in 2025</h2><p>Fortunately, there are a few ways you can watch the World Series (or at least part of it) without paying a cent. Two words: free trials. Not only does Fox One offer a free trial to new subscribers, but YouTube TV and Fubo do as well. If you've never subscribed to those services and you plan your trials accurately, you'll be able to watch the World Series for free &mdash;&nbsp;even if it goes to Game 7. If you don't qualify for any of the free trial options, we recommend either signing up for Fox One for one month at $19.99 or grabbing yourself a digital antenna. </p><h3>Fox One: 7-day free trial</h3><div class="flex relative flex-col p-6 mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans border border-gray-100 md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>Fox One, the new direct-to-consumer streaming service from Fox, gives subscribers access to the entire Fox TV portfolio. That includes your local Fox station live, as well as Fox News, Fox Sports, Fox Weather, FS1, FS2, Fox Business, Fox Deportes, Big Ten Network (B1G), Fox Network, and Fox Nation. Basically, if it's on Fox, it's on Fox One. A subscription costs $19.99 per month or $199.99 per year, but new subscribers can kick things off with a free trial that lasts an entire week. Depending on how many games the World Series goes into, you may be able to watch the entire thing with your trial.</p><h3>YouTube TV: 5-day free trial</h3><div class="flex relative flex-col p-6 mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans border border-gray-100 md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>YouTube TV is a comprehensive cable replacement service with over 100 live TV channels, unlimited DVR, and customizable add-ons. It's definitely overkill if you're just looking to watch your local Fox station for the World Series, but it holds a lot of value if you want to watch live TV long-term. You can test the waters for five days with a free trial if you're new to YouTube TV, which would give you the ability to watch at least part of the World Series for free. Just beware: if you forget to cancel, you'll be charged $72.99 (for the first three months).</p><h3>Fubo: 5-day free trial</h3><div class="flex relative flex-col p-6 mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans border border-gray-100 md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>Like YouTube TV, Fubo offers TV lovers a cable replacement with tons of live channels. It also offers a five-day free trial for new subscribers, giving you the ability to watch the World Series (or at least part of it) for free. Unlike YouTube TV, there are multiple tiers you can choose from. The Sports tier only offers 26 channels, including Fox, and will only run you $45.99 for your first month, should you forget to cancel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to the Raine family's counsel, OpenAI reversed that policy in May 2024, days before the launch of its <a href="https://mashable.com/article/chatgpt-users-emotional-reactions-gpt-4o" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">controversial GPT-4o model</a>.

Still, OpenAI prohibited the model from encouraging or enabling self-harm.</p><p>By February 2025, the amended complaint alleges that the rule was watered down from a straight prohibition under its restricted content guidelines to a separate directive to "take care in risky situations" and "try to prevent imminent real-world harm." While the model continued to receive instructions not to encourage self-harm under that rubric, the Raine family believes these conflicting guidelines led to dangerous engagement by ChatGPT. </p><p>Raine died two months after those policies were implemented.

As we inch toward the end of October, Wrapped <em>should</em> be coming soon.

Here's what we know.</p><h2>When will Spotify Wrapped be released?</h2><p>The short answer is: We don't know, exactly. The slightly longer answer is: We don't know, but we have an educated guess when it will be.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/2024-spotify-wrapped-when-how-to-view" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wrapped dropped</a> on Wednesday, Dec. 4.

That was &mdash; you guessed it &mdash; the first Wednesday after Thanksgiving. </p><p>Should the pattern hold, that means 2025 Spotify Wrapped would be released on Wednesday, Dec. 3. That's not a guarantee, by any means, but you can likely expect Wrapped to drop <em>around </em>that time, at the very least. </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>How to view Spotify Wrapped</h2><p>It shouldn't be difficult to find your Wrapped on the day it releases. </p><p>You'll likely get a notification letting you know it's ready.

However, the company's operating costs skyrocketed by 50 percent. So, even with a rise in revenue thanks to a spike in sales, Tesla reported just $1.4 billion in profit in Q3 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>That's out of $25.2 billion in revenue and down from last year's $2.2 billion in income.</p><p>Tesla's woes don't stop there. Even the major positive for the company &mdash; a sales boost in the third quarter, when the company sold a record number of EVs &mdash; has a major asterisk.</p><h2>Tesla's problems are just beginning</h2><p>For years, Tesla has been buoyed by tax credits and regulatory carbon credits, but it can't rely on either going forward.</p><p>In fact, the Q3 sales bump Tesla reported appears to be the result of consumers rushing to purchase an EV before the $7,500 federal EV tax credit program expired on September 30. Instead of a turnaround, this was a one-time event driven by last-minute buyers who were already planning to purchase a vehicle and wanted to take the last opportunity to save money with the EV tax credit.</p><p>Tesla delivered 497,099 vehicles in Q3. However, it looks unlikely that the company will be able to replicate those sales numbers without the tax credit that gave buyers a push to make their purchase.</p><p>But there's more to Tesla's problems, too. Of the company's third-quarter profits, $417 million came from Tesla selling regulatory carbon credits to other automakers. These regulatory credits have long been a significant chunk of the EV company's revenue. However, as part of President Donald Trump's budget bill, the U.S. government is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-credits-vital-revenue-source-lost" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>set to end the carbon credit</u></a> program, thus cutting Tesla off from a major source of revenue.</p><p>Musk himself is a major contributor to Tesla's problems. The company's revenue troubles <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-net-income-drops-70-percent-q4-2024-quarterly-report" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>began</u></a> shortly after Musk made himself and the Tesla brand a pariah to liberal-leaning customers as a result of his connections to President Trump and Musk's involvement in DOGE.</p><p>Despite all of this though, Musk still made the case for a $1 trillion compensation package during the quarterly earnings call so that he could control <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-trillion-robot-army-tesla" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Tesla's "robot army."</u></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

The company has Beats&rsquo; platform-neutral technology at its disposal. Furthermore, the AirPods Pro 3 are designed to share biometric data with third-party workout apps.&nbsp;</p><p>So, are these buds a solid match for Android users?</p><p>Let&rsquo;s just say that while some things changed, others certainly didn&rsquo;t. Here are my thoughts on the AirPods Pro 3 after testing them for three weeks on an Android device.</p><h2>I can&rsquo;t deny their sonic greatness</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>These are easily the best-sounding AirPods to date. They have a more refined soundstage with deeper bass response.&nbsp;</p><p>The drums and synths of contemporary bangers like Kaytranada&rsquo;s "Drip Sweat" sound prominent. I always felt these elements were tame on the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-2-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>AirPods Pro 2</u></a>. You can hear how well-balanced the low end is once the bouncy bassline and monstrous drums come on. R&amp;B bops like Shalamar&rsquo;s "A Night to Remember" showcase the AirPods Pro 3&rsquo;s frequency range. The track&rsquo;s crystal-clear mids and sharp highs blend beautifully with punchy bass.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the AirPods Pro 3&rsquo;s lack of hi-res audio codecs, they produce satisfying sound quality when streaming music over Bluetooth via an Android device. I could hear the details and subtle nuances on most recordings.</p><p>Personalized Spatial Audio hasn&rsquo;t changed much. It remains a terrific feature for lively listens. The results show when watching live-action movies and performances. Sound effects are more immersive and properly placed in the soundscape when moving your head.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple&rsquo;s active noise cancellation has improved. It is supposed to be twice as strong as the previous version on the AirPods Pro 2. I don&rsquo;t believe that. Nonetheless, these buds neutralize ambient noise at a surprisingly high level. Nearly all low- and mid-frequency sounds are muted. Many high-frequency sounds are either silenced or greatly minimized. Occasional disruptors such as crying babies and emergency vehicle sirens are audible, but they won&rsquo;t break your concentration. The updated Transparency mode is just as effective for increasing ambient awareness without compromising sound quality.</p><h2>Why can&rsquo;t Apple just embrace Android optimization?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Every new AirPods launch infuriates me more. How is Apple seven models in and can&rsquo;t make its wireless earbuds easily pairable with Android devices? Seriously. The company has Beats&rsquo; proprietary chipset, which integrates native Android features like Google Fast Pair and Find My Device, while also granting access to 80 percent of the features tied to Apple&rsquo;s H2 processor. The <a href="https://in.mashable.com/tech/91350/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-brings-improved-comfort-and-audio-performance" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Powerbeats Pro 2</u></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/beats-fit-pro-runners" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Fit Pro,</u></a> and all other current Beats releases employ this technology. It is the simplest fix for what has felt like an infinite inconvenience.&nbsp;</p><p>Some Apple fans will argue that the company has made attempts to simplify Android pairing, such as replacing the setup button from the charging case with a touch pad on the front that enables pairing mode when tapped twice. Here&rsquo;s the problem: the touch pad is finicky. It takes multiple attempts to activate the feature. Once you get it working, you still have to enter the Bluetooth settings to manually pair the buds.</p><p>Fast Pair would get the AirPods Pro 3 running on an Android phone in less than 3 seconds.&nbsp;</p><h2>Are Android users really losing out on Apple&rsquo;s true wireless audio experience?</h2><p>Simply put, yes. That&rsquo;s because many of the AirPods Pro 3&rsquo;s best features are kept exclusive to iOS. These include all-new additions like heart rate monitoring and real-time Live Translation, along with standard H2 perks (like auto switch, Conversation Boost, and &ldquo;Hey Siri&rdquo; voice activation). Some of these may not seem like deal-breakers. At the same time, you&rsquo;re not splurging to settle on hallmarks such as adaptive noise cancellation and high-quality sound, which you can get from other similarly priced rivals, even the less expensive AirPods Pro 2.</p><h2>Are the AirPods Pro 3 worth it?</h2><p>As an Apple user &mdash; iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook, iMac, whatever &mdash; the AirPods Pro 3 are absolutely worth the investment. Android users must look elsewhere for a premium true wireless experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple&rsquo;s restricted feature set makes these buds less appealing to Android device owners. It&rsquo;s a shame, too, considering how great they sound, both from an audio and noise-canceling perspective.</p><p>The better value lies in Beats wireless earbuds, which are ideal options for those who constantly swap between iOS/macOS and Android devices, such as yours truly. Consider looking over the best <a href="https://mashable.com/category/beats" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Beats</a> headphones if you need recommendations. If not Beats, then Sony&rsquo;s most popular earbuds are the way to go, specifically the class-leading <a href="https://mashable.com/review/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>WF-1000xM5</u></a>, which deliver excellent sound, powerful ANC, and versatile multiplatform support.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Could we all just imagine Kevin James has a 'day job' teaching young kids under an alias and they have no idea who he is because they&rsquo;re too young. Parents show up for conferences looking hella confused because their kids never told them Kevin James was their teacher," one commenter wrote on the first video.</p><blockquote class="tiktokEmbed tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7562308768042618142" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<p>In total, Taylor has uploaded five videos, which have garnered between 700,000 and 2.4 million views. </p><p>Taylor didn't respond to a request for comment from Mashable, and neither did James's representatives, but there are three main theories floating around the internet: </p><ol><li><p>Matt Taylor happens to be Kevin James' doppelg&auml;nger. They are two different people.</p></li><li><p>Kevin James is pulling a KJ Apa.</p></li><li><p>This is promotion for Kevin James' new movie.</p></li></ol><p>The first option strikes me as wrong because I spent many hours watching <em>The King of Queens</em> after school and I still have 20/20 eyesight.</p><p>The second option has some legs to it. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/music/music-news/mr-fantasy-tiktok-sensation-new-music-interview-kj-apa-1236375754/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">KJ Apa has a viral TikTok persona called Mr. Fantasy</a> in which he wears a wig and fake teeth and makes me uncomfortable, and this James role isn't <em>that</em> far off.</p><p>The third option feels most realistic to me. It looks like a significant amount of effort is going into these videos &mdash;  he has an entire classroom in one, he's in an art supply closet in another video, and a third video features a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thisismatttaylor/video/7564205518034603294" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">timelapse of him painting</a>. He's following one person &mdash; Ed Sheeran &mdash; but he has nearly 115,000 followers.

<p>Max subscribers can enable Memory in Settings today, while Pro users will see it roll out in the coming days. When turning on the feature, you give Claude a starting point and it starts building context from there. You can also import memory from ChatGPT or Gemini by copy and pasting &mdash; and you can export memory out of Claude, as well. </p><p>Memory is optional and can be toggled on or off. Users can also delete specific memories or use Claude incognito (which the company also introduced recently). </p><p>In a press release shared with Mashable, Anthropic claims that it conducted safety tests with memory, such as whether Claude would recall conversations with harmful language or become overly accommodating with potentially harmful user requests (an issue that has been <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-rolls-back-sycophant-chatgpt-update" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">observed in other LLMs</a> like ChatGPT, which has been criticized for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ai-psychosis-symptoms" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">feeding into some users' delusional thinking</a>).

<p>This QLED TV punches far above its weight class for the price. It offers bright lighting and reduces glare better than traditional LED TVs, and this one has a special AI Light Sensor as part of the line that can automatically adjust the TV's brightness based on the lighting in your room, much like a phone does. </p><p>Other than that, it offers Fire TV integration, which means you can watch shows and movies from a variety of streamers without having to install their respective apps on a streaming stick or device. It has a Game Mode Plus feature to help reduce input lag for gaming as well, if you're interested in using it for that purpose. </p><p>Overall, it's a great budget TV if you want a QLED model that acts as an all-rounder for whatever purposes you're looking to use it for. Grabbing it for under $300 is a great idea, so don't miss it while it's up at this price. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Our reviewer said they made the bass on specific tracks stand out in ways they'd never heard before without losing the other complexities of the sound. In other words, audiophiles will definitely appreciate the Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphones. The two drawbacks we found were that the ANC is just slightly worse than our other top picks from Sony and Bose (but not enough that you'll notice a huge difference) and the touch controls are a little inconvenient.

<p>The camping trips are winding down for the year, but there's likely still a need for a great cooler. Maybe you're heading out for one more weekend at the campground for leaf peeping or you'll be heading on a road trip over the holidays. Both of those will require a solid cooler to food transport and we're all in luck today thanks to a Woot sale.</p><p>As of Oct. 23, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeK8m7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=45-quart%20Ninja%20FrostVault%20cooler&object_type=article&object_uuid=07iSCmeFEmzGNRZkAiMBHmN&short_url=aeK8m7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">45-quart Ninja FrostVault cooler</a> is on sale at Woot for $199.99, down from the list price at <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLMp1m?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ninja&object_type=article&object_uuid=07iSCmeFEmzGNRZkAiMBHmN&short_url=QLMp1m&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ninja</a> of $299.99.

<p>Ninja also put durable, all-terrain wheels on the FrostVault, so you can roll through gravel, sand, or the through the creek. The pull handle is also a great design. Ninja mentions this model can keep ice for days and the 45-quart capacity works out to about 68 cans without ice.

<p>If you're deciding between the Kindle Paperwhite or Kobo Clara Colour, one thing that won't factor into your decision is price, as both devices cost $159.99. The Kobo Clara Colour does come ad-free though, and if you want an ad-free Paperwhite, you'll need to pay an extra $20.</p><p>So if price isn't a factor, let's get into the overall design of each device. Here are their dimensions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Kobo Clara Colour:</strong> 6.3-inch x 4.4-inch x 0.36-inch with 6-inch display</p></li><li><p><strong>Kindle Paperwhite:</strong> 7-inch x 5-inch x 0.3-inch with 7-inch display</p></li></ul><p>Overall, the Kindle Paperwhite's display is one inch bigger than the Kobo Clara Colours'. Plus, the Paperwhite's screen is flush to the frame, while the Kobo Clara has a raised bezel around the screen.</p><p>Each has adjustable warmth and brightness displays, so you can turn up the brightness when you're in the sunny outdoors or turn it down and warm it up in the evenings. Plus, both devices have a resolution of 300 ppi in black and white; the Kobo Clara Colour's resolution in color is 150 ppi.</p><p>Each device is also waterproof, both earning an IPX8 rating, meaning they can be submerged in up to 2 meters of water for up to 60 minutes. AKA, they're safe to take in the bathtub or to the beach.</p><p>The Kobo Clara Colour, as implied by its name, has color displays, while the Kindle Paperwhite does not. If you want a color Kindle, you'll need to look at the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/amazon-kindle-colorsoft" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Colorsoft</a>. This makes the Clara ideal for readers of graphic novels or comics.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

        </div>
    </div>
<p>The lock screens on each device are slightly different, too. When not in use, the Kindle Paperwhite shows random ads &mdash; unless you pay the $20 extra to get the device ad-free. Meanwhile, the Kobo Clara Colour shows the last book you read, along with your progress in the book.</p><p>Each has a power button, too. The Paperwhite's is on the bottom, which is slightly annoying as it can be easy to press accidentally, while the Clara's power button rests on the back corner of the device.</p><p>Considering all of these factors, the Kobo Clara is our winner here, since it has the bonus of color displays. Plus, its smaller design makes it more comfortable to hold for longer periods of time.</p><p><strong>Winner: Kobo Clara Colour</strong></p><h2>Kindle Paperwhite vs. Kobo Clara Colour: User experience</h2><p>The user interface and experience on the Clara and Paperwhite are fairly similar. </p><p>A priority for many e-reader users is having access to Libby/OverDrive. Kobo has the ultimate integration, as OverDrive is built into all of its devices, including the Clara Colour. That means any e-book you borrow from your library will auto-populate on your Kobo.</p><p>To get library e-books on your Kindle requires a few extra steps, as you'll need to access the Libby app to browse books and then send them to your Kindle library.</p><p>You can access the Kindle and Kobo stores on the respective e-readers. With the Kobo, you can select which book you want to purchase, but to complete the purchase, you need to scan a QR code on your phone. It's a simpler process on the Kindle, as you're able to check out on your Kindle e-reader.</p><p>A feature that makes the Kindle stand apart is its Goodreads integration, which allows you to link your account to your Kindle.</p><p>Each device is equally intuitive and user-friendly, so for us, it's a draw.</p><p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p><h2>Kindle Paperwhite vs. Kobo Clara Colour: Reading experience</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

        </div>
    </div>
<p>But how is it to actually read on each device? Each e-reader has an intuitive user interface and a responsive display as you swipe through pages. Plus, both the Paperwhite and Clara allow you to customize their swipe responses to your preferences.</p><p>Where the two devices differ in the reading experience is in page numbers and progress markers. Kindle numbers its pages like the physical book, while Kobo numbers the digital pages.</p><p>My editor, Miller Kern, and I each tested the Paperwhite and Clara and had two different opinions on how the devices numbered their pages. Miller was frustrated by how Kobo numbered its pages, so if you're reading along with someone who's reading a physical copy, it's hard to know if you're on the same page. On the other hand, I liked knowing exactly how many digital pages I had to tap through to finish the chapter or a whole book.</p><p>Where Miller and I do agree is that Kindle has better progress location options. On the bottom corner of each page, you can flip through what page you're on, how much time you have in the chapter, and how much time is left in the book. For that, I agree with Miller that the Kindle Paperwhite has a better reading experience.</p><p><strong>Winner: Kindle Paperwhite</strong></p><h2>Kindle Paperwhite vs. Kobo Clara Colour: Battery life</h2><p>In terms of battery life, the winner is obvious. The Kindle Paperwhite blows the Kobo Clara Colour out of the water. The Kindle Paperwhite has a battery life lasting up to 12 weeks. I use my Kindle Paperwhite regularly and only need to charge it every couple of months.</p><p>The Kobo Clara Colour says it lasts 42 days based on 30 minutes of reading per day. So at best you're getting 6 weeks. But if you're reading for multiple hours a day, this is going to be much less.</p><p><strong>Winner: Kindle Paperwhite</strong></p><h2>Kindle Paperwhite vs. Kobo Clara Colour: Is Kindle Unlimited or Kobo Plus better?</h2><p>Another thing to consider between the Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Clara Colour isn't actually about the e-readers, but the special memberships offered by each brand.</p><p>Kindle has <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-kindle-unlimited" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kindle Unlimited</a>, a membership that costs $11.99 per month and has four million digital titles that include books and magazines, as well as thousands of audiobooks. Kobo also has its own membership called <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVEXYx?pageview_type=RSS&template=comparison&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kobo%20Plus&object_type=comparison&object_uuid=0665rAYW2CG0mB41YFPgnOm&short_url=QVEXYx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"  title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kobo Plus</a>. It's slightly cheaper at $9.99 but has a smaller library. It has over two million ebooks and 150,000 audiobooks.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Small, yet mighty, the Explorer 2000 v2 is a solid mid-range power station designed for both home battery backup and on-the-go juice. As part of the Explorer lineup, it's lightweight enough (just under 40 pounds) to carry with you on camping trips, tailgating, boating, and other outdoor adventures. But it's also equipped with 2,042Wh capacity, making it powerful enough to serve as an essential home backup in emergencies. That's enough juice to keep your fridge up and running for over a day or heat up some grub in the microwave. It has three AC outlets, one USB-A port, and two USB-C ports, as well as a built-in light and a super-charge emergency mode.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 is another small but mighty power station that can power up multiple appliances with a 1,070Wh capacity. It has two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, one DC car port, and three AC ports, as well as LED lights on board. It's a tad lighter than the Explorer 2000 at about 24 pounds, making it a better choice if you're seeking easy portability. But the trade off is that it's less powerful.

Take it along to the campground on 4th of July weekend, use it in the yard for landscaping projects, and keep the refrigerator cooling during a power outage. These are all examples of why a portable power station is well worth its weight in gold. But when it comes to price, portable power stations tend to fall into that category of "these are almost always on sale." That's really great, yes. But it makes it a challenge to distinguish between a pretty good sale and a massive sale.</p><p>Rest assured these Anker Solix sale prices we've compiled sit in massive sale territory. Many of these beat previous record-low prices at Amazon and one is a brand new model that's on a major sale during pre-orders. Whichever you choose, you'll be in for a great deal while gifting yourself (or someone lucky) portable power. In our modern world, that's a pretty awesome present.</p><h2>Best overall Anker Solix Deal</h2><div class="flex relative flex-col p-6 mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans border border-gray-100 md:flex-row pogoClear">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>In testing, I was pretty smitten by the functionality of the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/anker-solix-c1000-portable-power-station" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">original Anker Solix C1000</a>, but the newer <a href="https://mashable.com/review/anker-solix-c1000-gen2-power-station" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Solix C1000 Gen 2</a> is a refined model. It's both smaller in overall dimensions and lighter weight, but it offers a similar power capacity at 1,024Wh. While the Gen 2 lacks the lightbar I love on the original model, the weigh difference and smaller size make the Anker Solix Gen 2 perfect for camping or for keeping around the house in case of a power outage. It's a great size to keep in the living room during an outage to power a lamp and keep phones charged up.</p><p>October Prime Day saw a record-low price on the original <a href="https://mashable.com/deals/oct-prime-day-deal-2025-anker-solix-portable-power-station" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">C1000</a>, but the new C1000 Gen 2 was kinda left out of the party. However, today, you can snag it for $397.99 at Amazon, which is a <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0FN7MSY4L" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">record-low</a>.

<p>While Reddit has signed agreements with other AI companies in the recent past, it has not done so with Perplexity. Reddit claims that it once sent a cease-and-desist letter to Perplexity for scraping Reddit content. Per Reddit's complaint, after the letter was sent, Perplexity started citing Reddit even more than before, not less. Where this really gets juicy is how Reddit claims it caught Perplexity in the alleged act of stealing data. In Reddit's words:</p><blockquote><p>"To confirm this hypothesis, Reddit created a &ldquo;test post&rdquo; &ndash; the equivalent of a digital &ldquo;marked bill&rdquo; &ndash; that could only be crawled by Google&rsquo;s search engine and was not otherwise accessible anywhere on the internet. Within hours, queries to Perplexity&rsquo;s &ldquo;answer engine&rdquo; produced the contents of that test post. The only way that Perplexity could have obtained that Reddit content and then used it in its &ldquo;answer engine&rdquo; is if it and/or its Co-Defendants scraped Google SERPs for that Reddit content and Perplexity then quickly incorporated that data into its answer engine."</p></blockquote><p>Perplexity provided a statement defending itself to The Verge.</p><p>&ldquo;Perplexity has not yet received the lawsuit, but we will always fight vigorously for users&rsquo; rights to freely and fairly access public knowledge,&rdquo; the company told The Verge. &ldquo;Our approach remains principled and responsible as we provide factual answers with accurate AI, and we will not tolerate threats against openness and the public interest.&rdquo;</p><p>We'll have to wait and see how the lawsuit pans out, but at least Reddit's tactic for allegedly catching Perplexity in the act is funny, if nothing else.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>From being named a population of "virgins" to being called sexless, the cultural conversation around these statistics has pushed the idea that Gen Z may be a sexually repressed generation. But is that really true?</p><h2>Sexual culture in a chronically online world&nbsp;</h2><p>While the decrease in sexual activity for Gen Z can't be boiled down to one factor, the role of the internet and social media may be a huge catalyst for this new wave of sexual behavior. With 81 percent of <a href="https://www.askattest.com/blog/research/gen-z-media-consumption" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Gen Zers using social media</u></a> daily, and half reporting that they spend three hours or more on it per day, internet usage has become a constant influence for most of Gen Z. This undeniably contributes to their general health, well-being, and understanding of sex.&nbsp;</p><p>This, however, is not a black-and-white story. Whether Gen Z is having less sex, and the function of the internet within this trend, isn't inherently good or bad. We are witnessing how aspects of ourselves and our relationships are affected by the conditions under which we are forced to create our values &mdash; such as for romance and sex. While medically accurate, comprehensive sex education is the most reliable gateway to explore those values for young people, it's not accessible to everyone. (Only 19 states require <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2025.308199" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>medically accurate information</u></a> on any sex ed topic as of 2025.)&nbsp;</p><p>The internet is offering a new &mdash; yet more complicated &mdash; route.</p><p>When internet and social media use become ingrained in the everyday lives of young people, the landscape in which they are exploring sexuality moves from physical to digital. This shift creates not necessarily a generational attitude of sexphobia at large, but a sexual culture shaped by the digital environment where they're immersed.&nbsp;</p><p>For some, that leads to more open and authentic sexual lives, while others internalize repressive sexual messaging.&nbsp;</p><h2>A different kind of sex education</h2><p>Gen Zers having less sex could be a result of seeing more perspectives around sexuality that are expanding their ideas of what sex can and has to be.&nbsp;</p><p>When algorithms show social media users wide perspectives of real-life people who engage with sexuality in all types of ways, we see how "online spaces have given Gen Z free sex education, which has helped them feel more confident in listening to their desires, which can lead to having less sex," says queer sex therapist <a href="http://avashakib.com" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Ava Shakib</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>For individuals who discover that they are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ace-book-angela-chen" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>asexual</u></a> or have experienced pressure to have sex, online sexuality discussions can offer "education around 'compulsory sexuality,' which can help explain parts of their experience. Feeling like an outsider can really tempt us into doing things we don't want to do," Shakib notes, which may have led to people in older generations consenting to sex they didn't really want to have.</p><p>When social media is able to show content to young people that broadens their understanding of sexuality, Gen Z engaging in less partnered sex can also be an outcome of less traditional definitions of sex. Sex educator <a href="https://www.sexedwithdb.com/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Danielle Bezalel</u></a>, MPH, says, "They may be defining sex as fingering, oral, anal, licking, kissing, masturbating, etc. This definition expansion around sex should be applied to sex for all people, as it's more inclusive and has less of an emphasis on straight cis-hetero sex."&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, lower reported sexual activity for Gen Z may also be a result of a growing gap between mainstream definitions of sex (partnered penis-in-vagina sex) and Gen Z's more expansive view on what sex can be (solo sex, sexting, kissing). When Gen Z sex statistics focus on heternormative partnered sex, there is no account for sexual activity that <em>is</em> happening for broader ideas of what sex can be.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this expansive view isn't always the case. Content on the "For You" pages of social media is not immune to replicating in-person oppressive messaging around sexuality. "Some youth get affirming content, while others are funneled toward abstinence-only or purity-culture narratives. And beyond the algorithm, patriarchal and misogynistic culture is always in the background, reinforcing shame, silence, and control over young people's bodies," says sex educator, <a href="https://voyageaustin.com/interview/life-work-with-irma-garcia-of-central-austin/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Irma Garcia</u></a>, CSE.&nbsp;</p><p>While social media access has the ability to deconstruct conservative sexuality narratives for some users, it also has the power to reinforce them. These algorithms can strengthen external shame around engaging in sex &mdash; in those cases, ultimately discouraging some Gen Zers away from it.</p><q>

Meta's history of reportedly <a href="https://mashable.com/article/instagram-shadowbanning-lgbtq-sex-educator-accounts" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>shadowbanning</u></a> sex educators, specifically Black and queer content creators, also limits the perspectives on sexuality that young people are being directed towards &mdash; supporting monolithic or even shameful narratives around sexuality.&nbsp;</p><h2>Heightened anxiety around sex</h2><p>Dr. Laurie Mintz, author of <a href="https://www.drlauriemintz.com/becoming-cliterate" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Becoming Cliterate</u></em></a> and sexpert at the sex toy brand LELO, adds that increased access to sexuality via digital platforms such as social media and dating apps may magnify the commodification of people through allowing users to swipe away from potential dating situations based on a perceived flaw or imperfection. These circumstances often reward whiteness, thinness, and cis-heteronormativity, comments Garcia, making relationships more fragile and redefining intimacy for Gen Z.&nbsp;</p><p>When digital platforms become the main space for exploration, this can also create more opportunity for anxiety and hesitation that may lead to less sex, specifically around rejection and perfectionism.&nbsp;</p><p>Bezalel discusses the rise in the number of Gen Zers who use <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/lifestyle/41-of-gen-z-are-using-ai-to-end-relationships-survey-finds/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>AI to write break-up texts</u></a>, noting "that number is only going to increase if we continue to teach young people that using AI and getting something 'right' is more valuable than trying your best, even if that means experiencing failure or rejection."</p><p>Time online for Gen Z may also translate to comparison through "the constant exposure to idealized bodies, idealized romance, or porn-shaped expectations can [also] heighten anxiety and make some young people hesitant to act on their desires," Garcia says. Therefore, making complicated situations like sex too anxiety-inducing to navigate.&nbsp;</p><p>This hesitation around sex for Gen Z can be shaped by hearing the complexity of sex talked about so openly online. Women, especially, may encounter "misogynistic messages about sex (e.g., body-count) that turn them off to engaging sexually, especially with men," explains Mintz.&nbsp;</p><p>For some, though, this may lead not to sexlessness, but rather a positive re-evaluation of wants around sex. Shakib says that, particularly for her femme clients, realizations around how sex can function as a means of validation may ignite alternate personal pleasure practices being prioritized. "My clients often find a fulfilling masturbation practice or find non-sexual activities, like dancing and reading, which fulfills their desire for pleasure."</p><h2>Higher screen time, lower intimacy</h2><p>More screen time for Gen Zers in comparison to other generations also means that in-person sexual experiences are getting pushed to the wayside. With most young people being raised in an era with social media and internet access being ingrained in everyday life, we can see how time spent on the internet might simply leave less time for sex.&nbsp;</p><p>"Sunshine makes us more happy and horny! We're so often cooped up in our homes, at jobs, and in cars&hellip; and we're suddenly locked in a place where there isn't much mental or physical energy left to pursue horny endeavors," Shakib tells Mashable. Bezalel shares this sentiment in that time spent online is time "they could be spending with friends or a partner or a new hookup that they are likely spending alone."</p><p>Increased time on social media may also be intensifying a gap between interest in sex and engaging in it. Reports of Gen Z having less sex don't necessarily add up to sexphobia or a wide disinterest in sex as a whole; it could be an indicator of the internet creating a wedge between intrigue and action.&nbsp;</p><q>

<p>"Young people can explore desire through fantasy, porn, or conversation without moving immediately into partnered sex. For some, that gap is protective. It lets them be curious without being pressured, and that can be a positive shift." Garcia explains.&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, access to sex ed online can contribute to hesitation or delay. But it isn't simply fear or repression," Garcia continues. "It's discernment, survival, disappointment with the options available, and the complexity of navigating sex in a world where information is more visible than before, but safe conditions are still not guaranteed."</p><p>"They may receive the message that sex isn't the norm for everybody and that they can choose for themselves," notes Mintz.&nbsp;</p><p>When young people have access to quality, comprehensive sex education classes coupled with exposure to shame-free messaging around sexuality online, sexual agency can look like having sex, not having sex, waiting to have sex, or exploring just because.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>
